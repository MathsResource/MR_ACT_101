\item 12 A simple model for the movement of a stock price is such that, independently in each
time period, the stock either:
goes up with probability (1 )

% ;
stays the same with probability (5 2 )
8
%   ;
goes down with probability (1 )
8
% .
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Determine the range of admissible values of the parameter . 
\item (a) Calculate the probability that the stock goes down in one time period, in the case  = 0.1.
(b) Calculate the probability that the stock stays the same for two consecutive time periods, in the case  = 0 .
(c) Calculate the probability that, in four time periods, the stock goes up twice and stays the same twice, in the case  % =  0.2 . [4]
\item Data are collected for 80 consecutive time periods and yield the following
observed frequencies:
change in stock up same down
no. of time periods 24 35 21
(a) (1) Write down an expression for L() , the likelihood of these
data, and show that
log L( ) 0 % 

reduces to the quadratic equation

(2) Explain why one of the roots of this quadratic yields the
maximum likelihood estimate of  and hence determine this
estimate. 
    \item 
\end{enumerate}
(b) (1) Calculate the expected frequencies using the model with the
maximum likelihood estimate of .
(2) Hence perform a 2
 goodness of fit test of the model and state
your conclusion clearly. 
(c) Comment briefly on what additional information would be needed for
these data in order to investigate the validity of the assumption of
independence used in this model, and comment briefly on how the
validity might be checked.

\item  Six insurance companies were being compared with regard to premiums being
charged for house contents insurance for houses in a particular postcode region.
Independent random samples of five policies from each company are examined and
the premiums (in £) were recorded.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Compute an ANOVA table for these data, and show that there are no
significant differences, at the 5\% level, between mean premiums being
charged by each company. 
\item State the assumptions required for the above analysis of variance, and, by
drawing a suitable diagram of these data, comment briefly on the validity of
these assumptions. 
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the underlying common standard
deviation % , using 2
SSR

as a pivotal quantity with a %  2  distribution. 
\item A colleague points out that company C has the largest mean premium of
£165.20 and that Company B has the smallest mean premium of £131.40 and
suggests performing a t-test to compare these two companies.
(a) Perform this t-test, using the estimate of variance from the ANOVA
table, and in particular show that there is a significant difference at the
1\% level.
(b) Your colleague states that there is therefore a significant difference
between the six companies.
Discuss the apparent contradiction with your conclusion and
explain the flaw in your colleagues argument.

years. The exposures of the groups, denoted Ex , are also given (the exposure is
essentially the number of women alive for the year in question). The values of the
death rates yx , where yx = nx/Ex , and the log(death rates), denoted wx , are also given.

\item A scatter plot of yx against x is shown below.
Draw a scatter plot of wx against x and comment briefly on the two scatter
plots and the relationships displayed. 
\item (a) Calculate the least squares fit regression line in which wx is modelled
as the response and x as the explanatory variable.
(b) Draw the fitted line on your scatter plot of wx against x.
(c) Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the slope coefficient of the
regression model of wx on x, adopting the assumptions of the usual
normal regression model.
(d) Calculate the fitted values for the number of deaths for the group aged
71 years and the group aged 76 years. 
\item Explain briefly the relationship between the fitting procedure used in part \item
and a model which states that the number of deaths Nx is a random variable
with mean Exbcx for some constants b and c.
