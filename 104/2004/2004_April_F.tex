%%---  Question 6
A life office issues a special 3 year term assurance policy to a man aged exactly 65.
The benefit payable at the end of the year of death is \$10,000 if death occurs in the
first year, \$15,000 if death occurs in the second year and \$30,000 if death occurs in
the third year. Premiums of \$400 per year are payable annually in advance for 3 years
or until earlier death. The random variable L is defined as the present value of the
loss under this policy calculated at the date of issue, so that:
L = present value of benefit outgo
\item 
present value of premium income
Calculate all the possible values that L can take, and hence find the mean and
standard deviation of L.

The office issues an endowment assurance contract to an identical life; death benefits
are the same as under the term assurance policy described above. In addition an
endowment benefit of \$30,000 is payable on survival to the end of the 3 year term.
Premiums of \$9,500 are payable annually in advance for three years or until earlier
death. The loss under this policy is denoted L*.
\item  Calculate the mean and standard deviation of L*. 
\item  Comment on your results. 
Basis: Mortality: AM92 Ultimate
Interest: 3% per annum throughout
Expenses are ignored

Therefore E(L) = \$313

Var(L) = 17,278, 044 313.43 2
= 17,179,806
so the standard deviation of L is \$4,145.

So E(L*) = \$286

Var(L*) = 379, 399 286.07 2
= 297,563
so the standard deviation of L* is \$545.

Although the means are more or less unchanged, the introduction of the
endowment element has greatly reduced the variance of the loss. This is
because there is much more certainty over the amount of the benefit that will
be paid
only the timing remains uncertain. %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
