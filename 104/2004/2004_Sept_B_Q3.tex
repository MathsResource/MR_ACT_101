A study has been undertaken into the effect of a new treatment on the survival times
of patients suffering from a tropical disease. The following model has been fitted:
h i ( t ) = h 0 ( t ) exp(
T
z )
where h i ( t ) is the hazard at time t, where t is the time since treatment
h 0 ( t ) is the baseline hazard at time t
z is a vector of covariates, where
z 1 = period from diagnosis to treatment in years
z 2 = 0 if existing treatment given, 1 if new treatment given
z 3 = 0 if female, 1 if male
is a vector of parameters, where
1 = 0.5
2 = 0.01
3 = 0.05
\item  State the group of lives to which the baseline hazard applies.
\item  For a male who was given the new treatment 6 months after diagnosis:
(a) Write down the hazard function, in terms of h 0 ( t ) only.
(b) Express the survival function, in terms of h 0 ( t ) only.

= 195,555.617
So, standard deviation = (195,555.617) 0.5 = \$442.22.
