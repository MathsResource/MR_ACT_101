The following data have been taken from a mortality investigation of a life
insurance company’s male whole of life policyholders aged between 25 and 65.
The graduated rates were obtained by fitting a mathematical formula to the
data. The formula has four parameters, which were estimated using the method
of maximum likelihood.

(i) Perform the Chi-squared test, and two other appropriate tests for the
adherence of this graduation to the data. Comment on the results of the
tests.
[8]
(ii) Describe the statistical rationale underlying the cumulative deviations
test, a test which is often used to assess adherence to data in a
graduation. State an important limitation of the test when used for this
purpose, and explain how you could overcome this limitation.

(i)
For all tests we assume H 0 : the graduated rates of mortality are the true
underlying mortality rates of the experience.
Chi-squared test: χ 2 = 10.5 with 3 degrees of freedom.
Significant at the 5% level since greater than 7.815.
Candidates who pointed out that the data given was only a sample from
the data used to fit the mathematical formula and thus argued that the
degrees of freedom should be >3 were also given credit.

Individual standardized deviations: −2.14 and −1.97 (just) outside ±1.96
2 out of 7 lie outside ±1.960, the upper and lower 2.5% points of standard
normal, and both are negative
There are 2 positive and 5 negative deviations, when are equal number of
each and are expected if this is true.
There are 3 absolute deviations < 0.67 and 4 greater than 0.67, when an
equal number of each expected if H 0 is true.
These results cast some doubt on whether the individual standardized
deviations are approximately standard normal, and this whether H 0 is
true.
These results cast some doubt on whether the individual standardized

Under null hypothesis, the probability of 2 or fewer groups of positive
signs is 1 so no reason to reject null hypothesis.

So not significant at 5% level.
Credit was not given for both the grouping of signs and serial correlations
test
Comments: The graduated rates are apparently too high over this age
range (see individual standardized deviations) but otherwise appear
adequate.
There was a misprint in the question. The standardised deviation of –0.43
should be +0.43. The majority of candidates used the standardised
deviations as given. Any candidate who recalculated the standardised
deviation and used +0.43 in subsequent tests received full credit. An upper
case Q in place of the correct lower case q in the column headings caused no
confusion to those who noticed it.

But independence assumption is highly dubious. Negative dependence is
