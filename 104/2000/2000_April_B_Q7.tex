Let X be a random variable representing the present value of the benefits of a
whole of life assurance, and Y be a random variable representing the present
value of the benefits of a temporary assurance with a term of n years. Both
assurances have a sum assured of 1 payable at the end of the year of death and
were issued to the same life aged x.
(i) Describe the benefits provided by the contract which has a present
value represented by the random variable X − Y.
(ii) Show that

Cov(X, Y) = 2 A x 1 : n − A x A 1 x : n
and hence or otherwise that
Var(X − Y) = 2 A x − ( n  A x ) 2 − 2 A x 1: n
where the functions A are determined using an interest rate of i, and
functions 2 A are determined using an interest rate of i 2 + 2i.

(i) X - Y is the present value of a deferred whole of life assurance with a sum
assured of 1 payable at the end of the year of death of a life now aged x
provided the life dies after age x + n.
(ii) X = v k+1

Cov(X, Y)

Where 2 A is determined using a discount function v 2 , i.e. using an interest
rate
i* = (1 + i) 2 - 1 = 2i + i 2
Then: Cov(X, Y) = 2 A x 1 : n - A x . A 1 x : n

Now: Var(X - Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) - 2 Cov(X, Y)
= ( 2 A x - ( A x ) 2 ) + ( 2 A x 1 : n - ( A x 1 : n ) 2 ) - 2( 2 A x 1 : n - A x . A x 1 : n )
= ( 2 A x + 2 A x 1 : n | - 2 2 A x 1 : n | ) - (( A x ) 2 + ( A 1 x : n | ) 2 - 2 A 1 x : n | A x )
= 2 A x - 2 A x 1 : n - ( A x - A 1 x : n ) 2
= 2 A x - 2 A x 1 : n - ( n 1⁄2 A x ) 2
Alternative approaches are possible.
