A life insurance company prices its long-term sickness policies using the following
3-state continuous-time Markov model, in which the forces of transition \sigma, \rho, \mu
and υ are assumed to be constant:
\sigma
State 1
(healthy)
\mu
State 2
(sick)
\rho
υ
State 3
(dead)
For a group of policyholders observed over a 1-year period, there are:
10 transitions from state 1 to state 2;
7 transitions from state 2 to state 1;
2 deaths from state 1;
3 deaths from state 2.
The total time spent in state 1 is 512 years, and in state 2 is 20 years.
(i) Write down the likelihood function for these data. 
(ii) Hence derive the maximum likelihood estimate of \sigma. 
(iii) Calculate an estimate of the standard error of \sigmâ , where \sigmâ is the
maximum likelihood estimator of \sigma .
