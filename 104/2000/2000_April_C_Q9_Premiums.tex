A special endowment assurance issued to a man aged 40 exact has a term of 25
years. A sum assured of £10,000 is payable immediately on death, and a sum
assured of £15,000 is payable on survival to the end of the term.
The policy is secured by annual premiums of P during the first five years, 2P
during the second five years and 3P during the remainder of the term.
Premiums are payable annually in advance for 25 years or until death, if
earlier.
(i) Show that the initial net annual premium for this policy is £164.23.
[6]
(ii) Determine the prospective net premium policy value at the end of the
twelfth policy year, immediately before the payment of the thirteenth
premium.

Basis: A1967–70 Ultimate Mortality Table. 4% per annum interest.
