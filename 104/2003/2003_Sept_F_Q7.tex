A very large employer is considering the simple three state Markov model of its
pension scheme shown below:
Employed (E)
v x
r x
Retired (R)
m x
Dead (D)
(i) Define t p x RD .
(ii) Suppose we observe a large number N of employees aged x. The ith life is
observed from age x+ a i to age x + b i where 0 \$ a i < b i \$ 1. Suppose that of
the employees observed, K retire and M die.

(a) Assuming the transition intensities are constant between ages x and
x + 1, write down the likelihood function for this data.
(b) Derive an expression for the maximum likelihood estimate r ˆ x of r x .
(iii)
The employer has observed that retired people are living longer than
anticipated and therefore increasing the cost of the pension scheme. Annual
records are kept of numbers of retired people at each age, and a summary is
given below.
Age last
birthday Number
of retired people
at 1 January 2001 Number

at 1 January 2002 Number

Use this data to estimate q 71 and q 72 stating clearly any assumptions you
make.

(i) p x RD is the probability that a life aged x and in the retired state at time 0 will
be in the dead state at time t.
(ii) (a)
t
Omitting the x subscripts for clarity, the likelihood function is given by
L = Const \int
N
∏ e − ( v +ρ )( b − a ) \int v M ρ K .
i
i
i = 1
This solution assumes (as was intended by the question) that
employees ceased to be observed when they retired. Credit was also
given if candidates assumed observation continued into retirement, so
that deaths after retirement were taken into account.
(b)
The log-likelihood is then given by
N
\sum  − ( v + ρ )( b i − a i ) + M log v + K log ρ .
logL = const +
i = 1
Differentiating to find the maximum gives
N
d
K
log L = − \sum  ( b i − a i ) + .
d ρ
ρ
i = 1
To find the maximum likelihood estimate, we set this equal to zero so
N
K
= \sum  ( b i − a i )
ρ ˆ i = 1
so
ρ ˆ =
K
N
\sum  ( b i − a i )
.
i = 1
We check this is a maximum by finding the second derivative:
d 2
d ρ
2
log L = −
K
ρ 2
< 0
so indeed we have a maximum.
