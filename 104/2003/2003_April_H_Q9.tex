From the formulae in the gold tables, we have
Var(X) = 2 A 1
45:20
and
2 1

(

45:20
= 2 A 45 - 1.04 - 40  ́
)

8821.2612
 ́ 0.30855
9801.3123
= 0.0367386
Then either
A 1
45:20
= A 45 - 1.04 - 20  ́
l 65
 ́ A 65
l 45
= 0.27605 - 1.04 - 20  ́
8821.2612
 ́ 0.52786
9801.3123
= 0.059230
so that
Var( X ) = 0.0367386 - 0.059230 2
= 0.033230
Or
A 1
45:20
= M 45 - M 65
D 45
= 463.20 - 363.82
1677.97
= 0.059226
so that
Var( X ) = 0.0367386 - 0.059226 2
= 0.033231

For Z the endowment and the term assurance are issued to the same life.
Therefore, the only uncertainty for Z is when the payment will be made — the
benefit is certain to be paid at some point. Therefore the lowest value taken by
Z is v 20 .
On the other hand X + Y represents two policies issued to independent lives.
Therefore, there is a possibility that no benefits could be paid at all, or that a
benefit of 2 could be paid in total. The results are therefore more variable.
