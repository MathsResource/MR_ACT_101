In a clinical trial, 50 patients are observed for two years following treatment with a
new drug. The following data show the period in complete months from the initial
treatment to the end of observation for those patients who died or withdrew from the
trial before the end of the two year period.
Deaths
6, 6, 12, 15, 20, 20, 23
Withdrawals 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 18

\begin{enumerate}
\item (i) Calculate the Nelson-Aalen estimate of the integrated hazard function, L t .
\itemv (ii) Hence, or otherwise, estimate the probability of a patient surviving for at least
18 months after the initial treatment.
\end{enumerate}
