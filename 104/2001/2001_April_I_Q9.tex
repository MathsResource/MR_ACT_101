Show that at age x if 0 \leq  a < b \leq  1 then
b − a q x + a

Hence, or otherwise, show that if deaths are uniformly distributed
over the year of age (x, x + 1) then
b − a q x + a

In a mortality investigation, the following data have been recorded for six
independent lives observed between exact age 70 and exact age 71.
a i the time in years after exact age 70 when the ith life came under
observation;
b i the time in years after exact age 70 when ith life was censored;
d i = 1 if the ith life died before x + b i ;
= 0 if the ith life survived to x + b i ;
t i if d i = 1, then x + t i is the age at which the ith life died.

Using the Binomial Model of Mortality write down the likelihood of
these observations.
If deaths are assumed to be uniformly distributed over (70, 71)
express this likelihood as a function of q 70 .
(b)
Using the Poisson Model of Mortality and assuming a constant
force of mortality, \mu 70 , over (70, 71) write down the likelihood of
these observations.
Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of \mu 70 and hence

obtain the maximum likelihood estimate of q 70 .

The same result can be obtained using the log likelihood.
Then ML estimator of q 70 ; q̂ 70 = 1 − e − 0.7692 = 0.5366
