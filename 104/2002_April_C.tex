PLEASE TURN OVER5
A life insurance company issued a 10-year temporary immediate annuity of £5,000
per annum to a life aged 44 exact on 1 January 1990. Annuity payments were
deferred for 10 years, so that the first payment was made on 1 January 2001.
Premiums were payable annually in advance until the end of the deferred period or
earlier death.
(i) State the Principle of Equivalence.
[1]
(ii) Calculate the level annual premium payable.
[5]
(iii) Calculate the Expected Death Strain for the calendar year 2004.
[4]
(iv) If the annuitant died during the calendar year 2004, calculate the Actual Death
Strain for this calendar year.

Basis: Mortality: A1967–70 Ultimate Males
Interest: 5% per annum interest effective throughout
Expenses are ignored

(i) Use the Chi-squared goodness of fit test to compare this experience with the
a(55) Ultimate Mortality Table for Male Annuitants. This was the mortality
basis used to determine the price of these annuities. State the null hypothesis
you are testing and comment on the results of your test.
[8]
(ii) Comment on the financial impact on the company if it continues to sell these
annuities with an unchanged mortality basis.
[1]
(iii) State how your test in (i) would be varied if you were testing graduated
o
mortality rates for adherence to the above data. The graduated rates, q x , were
determined by fitting the relationship
o
q x = a + bq x s
where q x s are rates from the a(55) Ultimate Mortality Table for Male
Annuitants. No further calculations are required.

Degrees of freedom for c 2 test = number of ages = 6.
One tailed test as large values of
å z x 2
indicate excessive deviations.
2
c 6,0.95
= 12.59
å z x 2 < 12.59 , so, there is no evidence to reject H 0 .
All deviations but one are negative, which could indicate the true mortality is
lighter than a(55). This is not detected by the Chi-squared test as the statistic
is based on squared deviations.
(ii) If the true mortality is lighter than a(55), the company will charge inadequate
premiums and will suffer a loss on the policies.
(iii) For testing adherence to data, the test statistic is unchanged, but the number of
degrees of freedom is reduced.
In fitting the relationship two parameters have been estimated so the number
of degrees of freedom will be reduced from 6 to 4, with a further deduction of
2 or 3 degrees of freedom for the constraints imposed by the choice of the
standard table.
A solution to (i) using E x q x as an estimate of the variance is also acceptable,
provided the assumption 1 - q x ¦ 1 is stated. Candidates who modified their
answers because the data was an extract from the whole experience received credit.
