If K x is a random variable which measures the curtate future lifetime of a life aged x,
describe the benefits payable under policies that have the present value of their
benefits expressed as
(a) a K
K x = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
(b) a && min( K
x
x + 1, n + 1)
- 1
K x = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

An endowment assurance issued to a man aged exactly 30 provides the following
benefits:
·
·
a sum assured of £10,000 payable immediately on death before age 65
a sum assured of £50,000 on survival to age 65
Premiums are payable annually in advance for 30 years, or until death if earlier.
Calculate the level annual premium payable.

There is very little difference using alternative calculations for A 30:35
:
Using 1.03 instead of 1.06 1⁄2 leads to value of death benefit = 457.114 and P = 399.52.
