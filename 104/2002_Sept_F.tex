(i)
(a)
An endowment assurance with a term of 20 years is sold to a life aged
exactly 50. The assurance has a sum assured of £1,000 payable
immediately on death or on survival to the end of the term. Premiums
are paid continuously until the end of the term of the policy or until
earlier death.
Show that the net level annual premium is £37.16.
(b)
Show that the net level annual premium for a term assurance with the
same sum assured and the same term is £19.06.
[7]
Basis: Mortality: English Life Table No. 12 Males
Interest: 6% per annum effective
Expenses are ignored
(ii)
Using the same basis as in (i), calculate the net premium policy value at
duration 15 for:
(a)
(b)
the endowment assurance described in (i)(a)
the term assurance described in (i)(b)
[7]
(iii) On the same scale and axes sketch graphs of the net premium policy values of
each of the endowment assurance and the term assurance against the term of
the policy.
[4]
(iv) Thiele’s equation for the endowment assurance policy is
¶
t V ( A 50:20 ) = d t V ( A 50:20 ) + P ( A 50:20 ) - (1 - t V ( A 50:20 )) m x+t
¶ t
Write down Thiele’s equation for the term assurance policy.
(v)
104 S2002—5
0 < t < 20
[2]
Use the equations from (iv) and the calculations from (i) and (ii) to explain the
shape at policy duration 15 of the graphs you have drawn in (iii). You should
provide calculations to support your explanations.

These are expressed as equivalent annual rates of change measured at policy
duration 15.
Here d = log e 1.06 = 0.058269
So components are

So at policy duration 15 the endowment assurance is increasing in value and
the term assurance is decreasing in value.
