\item 5 In a quality control test, a random sample of 100 items is selected, of which 90 are
found to be satisfactory. The value of p, the probability of an item being satisfactory,
is unknown.
Write down the probability of observing 90 satisfactory items out of 100 as a function
of p, and thus derive the maximum likelihood estimate of p. [3]

\item 6 A national survey research company has past data which indicate that the interview
time for a consumer opinion study has a standard deviation of 6 minutes.
Calculate the size of the sample that should be taken if the company requires a 99%
confidence interval for the mean interview time to be within 2 minutes. 
\item 7 The following information on white blood cell count (WBCC) was collected from
subjects one week after the start of chemotherapy treatment. One group of subjects
(A) received steroids in addition to the chemotherapy treatment and the other group
(B) received a placebo in addition to the chemotherapy. The subjects were assigned
to the groups at random.
Group A  Steroid
WBCC (millions of cells per ml.)
12.4 15.2 12.7 15.9 12.2 14.2 12.9 14.2 12.4 14.6

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Construct stem and leaf diagrams for Group A and Group B separately. 
\item Comment on the results in the context of investigating an association between
WBCC and the treatment with or without steroids.

\item The distribution of WBCC is similar for both groups in that the medians are
similar (Group A median = (13.3 + 13.6)/2 = 13.45; Group B median = (13.5
+ 13.6)/2 = 13.55), and both distributions are slightly positively skewed.
There is a slightly greater variability in the steroid group compared to the
placebo group. It appears that the steroid treatment has no difference in effect
from the placebo.
