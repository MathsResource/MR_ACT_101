\item 1 Data were collected on 100 consecutive days for the number of claims, x, arising
from a group of policies. This resulted in the following frequency distribution
x: 0 1 2 3 4 ≥5
f: 14 25 26 18 12 5
Calculate the median and interquartile range for these data. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 2 Let X1 and X2 be independent Poisson random variables with respective means μ1
and μ2.
Assuming the moment generating function of a Poisson random variable,
determine the moment generating function of X1 + X2 and hence state the
distribution of X1 + X2 .

Assuming the usual expressions for the estimated coefficients, verify that the
least squares fitted regression line of y on x passes through the point (x, y).
