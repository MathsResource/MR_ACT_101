\item 1 A random sample of fifty claim amounts (£) arising in a particular section of an
insurance company's business are displayed below in a stem and leaf plot:

Stem unit = 100

The sum of the fifty amounts (before rounding) is £92780.
Calculate the mean and median claim amounts.

\item Consider a random sample of 47 white-collar workers and a random sample of 24 blue-collar workers from the workforce of a large company. The mean salary for
the sample of white-collar workers is £28,470 and the standard deviation is £4,270; whereas the mean salary for the sample of blue-collar workers is £21,420
and the standard deviation is £3,020.
Calculate the mean and the standard deviation of the salaries in the combined
sample of 71 employees. 
3 The number of claims arising in a period of one month from a group of policies
can be modelled by a Poisson distribution with mean 24.
Determine the probability that fewer than 20 claims arise in a particular month.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
1 Mean = 92780/50 = £1855.60
25.5th value in order = (17.3 + 17.4)/2 = 17.35 so median amount = £1735
2 For simplicity change the units into thousands. The sum of the data is
Σx = 47 × 28.47 + 24 × 21.42 = 1,852.17.
So, the mean salary is 1852.17
71 = 26.087, or £26,087.
The sum of squares is given by
Σx2 = {46 × 4.272 + 47 × 28.472} + {23 × 3.022 + 24 × 21.422} = 50,155.5.
Thus, the standard deviation of the 71 values is
50155.5 1852.172 71

= 5.124, or £5,124.
3 Can get answer directly from Green tables:
P(X < 20) = P(X ≤ 19) = 0.18026 = 0.18
OR: use normal approximation with continuity correction.
\[X ~ N(24, 2 24 )
P(X < 20) → P(X < 19.5)\]
=
19.5 24
= 0.92

= 1 − 0.82 = 0.18.
Note: without continuity correction answer is 0.15 — only 1 mark.

4 Suppose that a random sample of nine observations is taken from a normal
distribution with mean μ = 0. Let X and S 2 denote the sample mean and
variance respectively.
Determine (to 2 decimal places) the probability that the value of X exceeds that of S, i.e. determine P( X > S) . 

4 μ = 0, n = 9 so X / (S / 3) ~ t8 so P( X > S) = P(t8 > 3) ,
which, from tables, is just less than 0.01
(actually 0.0085, but not needed for the marks)

Q7 Comment: An alternative approach is to use Fisher’s transformation of r. The
statistic is
1+ r
½log
1- r
, which, under H0, has, approximately, a N(0,1/7) distribution.
This approach gives r = 0.630 .
