\item 1 The following amounts are the sizes of claims (£) on house insurance policies for a
certain type of repair.
\begin{verbatim}
198 221 215 209 224 210 223 215 203 210
220 200 208 212 216
\end{verbatim}

Determine the lower quartile, median, upper quartile and interquartile range of
these claim amounts. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 2 A certain medical test either gives a positive or negative result. The positive test
result is intended to indicate that a person has a particular (rare) disease, while
a negative test result is intended to indicate that they do not have the disease.
Suppose, however, that the test sometimes gives an incorrect result: 1 in 100 of
those who do not have the disease have positive test results, and 2 in 100 of those
having the disease have negative test results.
If 1 person in 1000 has the disease, calculate the probability that a person with a
positive test result has the disease. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 3 Suppose that the occurrence of events which give rise to claims in a portfolio of
motor policies can be modelled as follows: the events occur through time at
random, at rate μ per hour. Then the number of events which occur in a given
period of time has a Poisson distribution (you are given this).
Show that the time between two consecutive events occurring has an exponential
distribution with mean 1/μ hours. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 4 For a certain type of policy the probability that a policyholder will make a claim
in a year is 0.001. If a random sample of 10,000 policyholders is selected,
calculate an approximate value for the probability that not more than 5 will
make a claim next year. [2]

3 Let the number of events in a period of time of length t hours be Xt .
\begin{itemize}
\item Then X1 ~ Poisson(μ) and Xt ~ Poisson(μt).
\item Let the time between two consecutive events be T.
\item Then P(T > t) = P(no events in period of length t) = P(Xt = 0) = exp(−μt).
\item So P(T < t) = 1 − exp(−μt) [and so f(t) = μ exp(−μt) , t >0]
\item Hence T ~ exponential with mean 1/μ hours.
\end{itemize}
