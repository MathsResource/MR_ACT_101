1 The following amounts are the sizes of claims (£) on house insurance policies for a
certain type of repair.
198 221 215 209 224 210 223 215 203 210
220 200 208 212 216
Determine the lower quartile, median, upper quartile and interquartile range of
these claim amounts.

2 A certain medical test either gives a positive or negative result. The positive test
result is intended to indicate that a person has a particular (rare) disease, while
a negative test result is intended to indicate that they do not have the disease.
Suppose, however, that the test sometimes gives an incorrect result: 1 in 100 of
those who do not have the disease have positive test results, and 2 in 100 of those
having the disease have negative test results.
If 1 person in 1000 has the disease, calculate the probability that a person with a
positive test result has the disease. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
3 Suppose that the occurrence of events which give rise to claims in a portfolio of
motor policies can be modelled as follows: the events occur through time at
random, at rate μ per hour. Then the number of events which occur in a given
period of time has a Poisson distribution (you are given this).
Show that the time between two consecutive events occurring has an exponential
distribution with mean 1/μ hours. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
4 For a certain type of policy the probability that a policyholder will make a claim
in a year is 0.001. If a random sample of 10,000 policyholders is selected,
calculate an approximate value for the probability that not more than 5 will
make a claim next year. [2]
5 Show that the probability generating function for a binomial (n, p) distribution is
GX (t) = (1 − p + pt)n .
Deduce the moment generating function. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
6 Let X have a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ, and let
the ith cumulant of the distribution of X be denoted κi .
Assuming the moment generating function of X, determine the values of κ2 , κ3 ,
and κ4 . 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
7 The number of policies (N) in a portfolio at any one time is modelled as a Poisson
random variable with mean 10.
The number of claims (Xi) arising on a policy is also modelled as a Poisson
random variable with mean 2, independently for each policy and independent
of N.
Determine the moment generating function for the total number of claims,

3 Let the number of events in a period of time of length t hours be Xt .
Then X1 ~ Poisson(μ) and Xt ~ Poisson(μt).
Let the time between two consecutive events be T.
Then P(T > t) = P(no events in period of length t) = P(Xt = 0) = exp(−μt).
So P(T < t) = 1 − exp(−μt) [and so f(t) = μ exp(−μt) , t >0]
Hence T ~ exponential with mean 1/μ hours.
