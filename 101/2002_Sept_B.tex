\item 5 Suppose that a line is fitted by least squares to a set of data $\leq$$\leq$ xi , yi  , i =1, 2,$\leq$, n
which has sample correlation coefficient r. Let the fitted value at xi be denoted yi .
Show that the sample correlation coefficient of the data $\leq$$\leq$ yi , yi , i =1, 2,$\leq$, n, that
is, of the observed and fitted y values, is also equal to r. [3]

\item 6 As part of an investigation an insurance company collected data for the year 2000 on
claims sizes for all claims on a certain type of motor insurance policy. The resulting
data are given below in the form of a grouped frequency distribution.
\begin{verbatim}
Claim size (£) Frequency
$\leq$ 100 862
> 100 and $\leq$ 200 608
> 200 and $\leq$ 300 1253
> 300 and $\leq$ 400 1066
> 400 and $\leq$ 500 558
> 500 1290
Total 5637
\end{verbatim}


\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) Calculate the cumulative frequencies and draw a graph of the claim size
distribution function (i.e. the cumulative frequencies against claim size). [3]
    \item (ii) You have been asked to determine the proportion of claim sizes which are less
than £250. Use linear interpolation to approximate this proportion to two
decimal places. 
    \item (iii) Use linear interpolation to approximate (to the nearest £) the value of the
median of the claim size distribution. [2]
\end{enumerate}

\item 7 Suppose that X is a continuous random variable uniformly distributed on (0, 1).
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item  Show that the moment generating function of Y =  log X is
MY(t) = 1/(1  t) for $t < 1$. 
    \item Hence state the distribution of Y. 
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 8 Assume that, for a group of insurance policies, the number of claims on each policy
can be modelled by a Poisson distribution with the same rate  per year,
independently for each policy. Such a group of 1500 policies gave rise to a total of
183 claims during the last year.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) State the value of the maximum likelihood estimate of . 
\item (ii) Hence obtain estimates of the following quantities:
(a) The probability that a subset of 10 of these policies results in no claims
over the next six months.
(b) The probability that a subset of 250 of these policies results in more
than 40 claims over the next year.

The maximum claim size is not given, and candidates were expected to exercise common
sense and judgement. One sensible approach is to leave the x-scale open-ended and indicate
the presence of a horizontal asymptote at cumulative frequency 5637.

uniqueness for the MGF this then implies that Y has this distribution.

\begin{itemize}
    \item (ii) (a) Number of claims X for 10 policies in six months is Poisson with
parameter 10(0.5)(0.122) = 0.61
\item P(no claims) = P(X = 0) = exp(	0.61) = 0.543
\item Alternative:
For a single policy P(no claim) = exp(	0.061) = 0.9408
For 10 policies P(no claims) = (0.9408)10 = 0.543
\item (b) Number of claims X for 250 policies in one year is Poisson with
parameter 250(0.122) = 30.5
\item Outwith scope of the Green tables, so we must use a normal
approximation:
X $\leq$ N(30.5,30.5)
\item Applying a continuity correction:
