\begin{enumerate}
\item
5 Ten independent hypothesis tests are to be conducted, each at the 5\% significance
level.
Calculate the probability that at least one of the tests produces a significant result,
assuming that the null hypothesis for each of the 10 tests is true, and comment briefly
on the value. 
\item 6 Show that the slope of the regression line fitted by least squares to the three points
$(0,0) , (1,y) , (2,2)$
is 1 for all values of $y$. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 7 Claims arise through time on a portfolio of policies one after another, at random, and
at a constant rate per week. Claim sizes are to be modelled as a N(, 2) random
variable, independent of the times of occurrence and the accumulated numbers of
claims.
The moment generating function of S, the total size of all claims which occur in a
period of $k$ weeks (where $k$ is a positive integer), is to be used in a theoretical report
being written by two students.
\begin{itemize}
    \item One student (A) suggests that the moment generating function of $S$ is given by:
Suggestion A :
\[
M_S ( t ) = exp \left( k\;\lambda \left{ exp \left[ \mu\;t + s 2 t 2 \right] - 1 \right} \; \right)
\]

\item The other (B) disagrees and suggests that it is in fact given by:
Suggestion B :

\[M_S ( t ) = exp \left( k\;\lambda exp \left[ \mu\;t + s 2 t 2 \right] - 1 \right)  \]
\end{itemize}

One of the students is correct. Determine which one this is.
\item 8 A student actuary is about to collect data from a batch of insurance proposal forms. It
is known that on average one in every fifty such forms contains incomplete
information, and the student wants to be 95\% sure of having at least 500 forms which
are complete.
Show that he must use a batch of at least 516 forms. (Use a suitable model and
appropriate tables for the distribution of the number of forms containing incomplete
information.) 
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage

5 P(at least one test is significant | each null hypothesis is true)\\
= 1 − P(no test is significant | each null hypothesis is true)\\
= 1 − (1 − 0.05)10 as the 10 tests are independent\\
= 0.4\\

Comment: a false-positive is very likely with the 10 multiple tests.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
6 Sxx = 5 – 32/3 = 2 , Sxy = y + 4 – 3(y+2)/3 = 2
So fitted slope = 2/2 = 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
7
\begin{itemize}
    \item N is Poisson(kλ) with $MN(t) = exp[kλ{exp(t) – 1}]$.
\item S has a compound distribution with mgf \[MS(t) = MN{logMX(t)}\]
and \[MX(t) = exp(μt + \sigma^2t2/2)]\.
\item So mgf of S is $MN(μt + \sigma^2t2/2)$ and correct suggestion is A.
\item OR: by using the result quoted in the Formulae and Tables book
\item OR: we must have $MS(0) = 1$, so B is wrong.
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

8 Let X be the number of forms with incomplete information in a batch of n forms.
Then X ~ Poisson(0.02n) approximately
\begin{itemize}
    \item With n = 516, $X \sim P(10.32)$ and $P(X \leq 16) = 0.965$ approx, by linear interpolation
\item With n = 515, $X \sim P(10.3)$ and $P(X \leq 15) = 0.940$ approx, by linear interpolation
\item So he requires 516 forms
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

OR: the distribution of X can be modelled approximately using a normal distribution
with mean 0.02n and variance 0.0196n; we require P(X ≤ n − 500) to be at least 0.95;
the analysis is more awkward, but solving a quadratic in n gives n ≥ 515
