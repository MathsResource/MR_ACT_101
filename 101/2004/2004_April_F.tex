The number of claims which arise in a year under a policy of a certain type follows a
Poisson distribution with mean . It is required to test
H0 : = 0.2 v H1 :
and it is decided to reject H0 in favour of H1 if 15 or more claims arise in a year under
a group of 50 independent such policies.
By using tables of Poisson distribution probabilities, calculate the power of this test in
each of the cases:
(a) = 0.3, and
(b) = 0.4
and comment briefly on the results. [5]

%%- April 2004 Question 10

Total number of claims $N \sim \mbox{Poisson}(50 \lambda)$

In the case $\lambda = 0.3$

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{Power} 
&=& P[N \geq 15| N \sim \mbox{Poisson}(15)]\\
&=& 1 -  P[N \leq 14|  N \sim \mbox{Poisson}(15)]\\
&=& 1 - 0.466\\
&=& 0.534 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

In the case $\lambda = 0.4$

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{Power} 
&=& P[N \geq 15| N \sim \mbox{Poisson}(20)]\\
&=& 1 -  P[N \leq 14|  N \sim \mbox{Poisson}(20)]\\
&=& 1 - 0.105  \\
&=& 0.895 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

Comment: power higher for
$\lambda = 0.4$, which is further away from $H_0$ value 0.2
