\item Claim sizes are normally distributed about a mean = £6,000 and with standard
deviation = £1000.
Calculate the probability that a claim is for more than £7,500, given that it is for more
than £6,000. [3]
\item Let X be a random variable which has a Poisson distribution with parameter .
(i) Write down the cumulant generating function CX (t). [1]
(ii) By differentiation of CX (t) show that the mean and variance of X are both
equal to . [2]

1 Let X be claim size in units of £1000: X ~ N(6,1)
P(X > 7.5|X>6) = P(X > 7.5 and X > 6) / P(X > 6) = P(X > 7.5) / P(X > 6)
= P(Z > 1.5) / P(Z > 0) where Z ~ N(0, 1)
= 0.0668 / 0.5 = 0.134
