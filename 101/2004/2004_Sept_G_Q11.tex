\item 11 The continuous random variables X and Y have a bivariate probability density
function
\[f(x, y) = 2 for 0 < x + y < 1, x > 0, y > 0.\]
The conditional distribution of X given Y = y is a uniform distribution with probability
density function
f(x|y) =
1
1 y
0 < x < 1 y
and the marginal distribution of Y is a beta distribution with probability density
function
\[ f(y) = 2(1 y) 0 < y < 1.\]
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i) Show that the conditional expectation of X given Y = y is
E(X|Y = y) =
1
,
2
y
and obtain the conditional variance of X given Y = y. 
\item (ii) Verify in this case that $var(X) = var(E(X|Y)) + E(var(X|Y))$. 
\end{enumerate}

11 (i) Using results for a uniform distribution given in the Yellow Book we obtain
the following
1

2

E X Y y
and
var(X|Y = y) =
(1 )2
12
y
since the conditional distribution of X given Y = y is a continuous uniform
distribution with parameters a = 0 and b = 1 y.
(ii)
1 1 1 1 1

since Y has a beta distribution with parameters = 1, = 2, and the Yellow

By symmetry with the random variable Y, X has a beta distribution with
parameters = 1, = 2, and
1

X .

% Examiners Comment: The question helpfully states that the conditional distribution is a uniform distribution and the marginal distribution is a beta distribution. Despite this many candidates failed to quote standard results given in the Yellow Book relating to uniform and beta distributions and instead performed time-consuming integrations.
