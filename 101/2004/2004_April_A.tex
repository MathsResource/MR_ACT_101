1 The probability that a claim is made on a certain type of policy in a particular year is
0.04. Five hundred policies are selected at random.
Use a suitable normal approximation to calculate the probability that no more than 30
of these will result in a claim during the year.

%- Question 2 

The interquartile range of a continuous distribution with distribution function $F(x)$ is
defined as IQR = x2 x1 where $F(x1) = 0.25$ and $F(x2) = 0.75$.
Show that for a normal distribution with variance 2, the interquartile range is
IQR = 1.349 . 
\newpage
2 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The required values of $x_1$ and $x_2$, the lower and upper quartiles, are such that:
$F(x1) = 0.25$ and $F(x2) = 0.75$,
i.e. 1 0.25
x
and 2 0.75,
x
where is the standard normal distribution function.
\item From the statistical table of the percentage points of the standard normal distribution,
we have
x1
= 0.6745 x1 = 0.6745
x2
= 0.6745 x2 = + 0.6745
where is the population mean and is the population standard deviation.
\item 
\begin{eqnarray*}
IQR &=& x_2 - x_1 \\
&=& 0.6745 + 0.6745\\
&=& 1.349 .
\end{eqnarray*}
