\begin{document}
An insurance company has a portfolio of large industrial insurance risks. Three such
independent risks, labelled A, B, C, are being investigated.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The sums insured, in units
of £100 million, are 2.5, 4.8, 7.2 for A, B, C, respectively.
\item The company's expert risk
assessors estimate that the probabilities of a claim arising in the next calendar year are
0.01, 0.02, 0.005 for A, B, C, respectively. 
\item If a claim does arise, then the full sum
insured will be paid out and no further claims can then arise for that risk. 
\end{itemize}
The above
probability estimates should be used throughout this question.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  Determine, for this group of three risks, using suitable indicator variables or
otherwise, the mean and standard deviation of the total claim amount paid out
in the next calendar year.
\item You are told that exactly one claim has arisen. Calculate the mean total claim
amount and comment on your answer in relation to your answer in part (i).
\end{enumerate}

7 (i) Let IA, IB, IC be indicator variables such that
P(IA = 1) = 0.01, P(IB = 1) = 0.02, P(IC = 1) = 0.005 and 0 otherwise.

Let T = total claim amount = 2.5 IA + 4.8 IB + 7.2 IC

\begin{eqnarray*}
E(T) &=& 2.5(0.01) + 4.8(0.02) + 7.2(0.005) \\ 
&=& 0.157 \qquad (\mbox{ or } £15.7m) \\
\end{eqnarray*}


\begin{eqnarray*}
Var(T) &=& 2.52(0.01)(0.99) + 4.82(0.02)(0.98) + 7.22(0.005)(0.995)\\ &=& 0.7714\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(1 claim) &=& P(A not BC) + P(B not AC) + P(C not AB)\\
&=& (0.01)(0.98)(0.995) + (0.02)(0.99)(0.995) + (0.005)(0.99)(0.98)\\
&=& 0.009751 + 0.019701 + 0.004851 \\
&=& 0.034303\\
\end{eqnarray*}


\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(A|1 claim) = 0.009751/0.034303 = 0.2843$
\item $P(B|1 claim) = 0.019701/0.034303 = 0.5743$
\item $P(C|1 claim) = 0.004851/0.034303 = 0.1414$
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
E(T |1 claim) = 2.5(0.2843) + 4.8(0.5743) + 7.2(0.1414) = 4.485
(or £448.5m)
Much larger given that a claim does in fact arise.
