%%-Question 10 
In order to estimate a certain probability of success a single observation is taken from
the binomial random variable $X ~ binomial(20, p)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (i) Write down an expression for the mean square error of the maximum
likelihood estimator,
20
X
p , and evaluate this mean square error at p = 0.5.

\item (ii) Determine an expression for the mean square error of the estimator,
1
21
X
p , and evaluate this mean square error at p = 0.5. [4]
\item (iii) Comment briefly on the comparison of p and p as estimators of p in the case
p = 0.5. 
\end{enumerate}

    \item (iii) Even though p is the MLE and is unbiased, p is a more efficient estimate
(for p = 0.5) having a smaller mean square error.
