\item
5 Suppose that is an unbiased estimator of a parameter and has variance
2
10
.
Derive an expression for the mean square error of k , where k is a constant, and
determine the value of k for which the mean square error is a minimum.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let X and Y be random variables which each takes values 1 and 2 only.
Calculate $E[X|Y = 2]$, given that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $E[X] = 6/5$, 
\item $E[X|Y = 1] = 7/6$, 
\item $P(Y = 1) = 3/5$.
\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}

\begin{eqnarray*}
MSE(  \hat{\theta}) &=& E((  k\hat{\theta} - \theta )^2) \\
&=& var( k\hat{\theta} ) + [E( k\hat{\theta})]^2 -  2\theta E( k \hat{\theta} ) +  \theta^2 \\
&=& k^2 \frac{\theta^2}{10} + (k\theta)^2 - \2 \theta (k \theta) + \theta^2 \\
&=& \theta^2 \left(  \frac{k^2}{10} + k^2 - 2k +1 \right) \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\[\frac{d}{dk} \left(MSE(  \hat{\theta})  \right) =   \theta^2 \left(  \frac{2k}{10} + 2k +2 \right) =0 \]

Therefore
\[k = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}+1} = \frac{10}{11}\]


\begin{itemize}
\item This is clearly a minimum as the MSE is a quadratic in $k$ and the coefficient of $k^2$ is
positive.
\item OR: Note explicitly in first line that 2 MSE k var k bias k
\item Note: Many candidates stated in error that $k$ was unbiased for . 
\item Some attempted to minimise the function of k by differentiating with respect to rather than k.
\end{itemize}

\begin{eqnarray*} E[X] &=& E[E[X|Y]] \\ &=& P(Y = 1) E[X|Y = 1] + P(Y = 2) E[X|Y = 2]\\
\end{eqnarray*}
So 1.2 = 0.6 (7/6) + 0.4 E[X|Y = 2] and so E[X|Y = 2] = 1.25
