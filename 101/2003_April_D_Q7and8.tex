7 A group of 500 insurance policies gave rise to a total of 83 claims during the last year.
Assuming a Poisson model for the occurrence of claims, calculate an approximate
95\% confidence interval for , the claim rate per policy per year.

\item 8 The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of a random variable is called the
coefficient of variation.
For each of the following distributions, decide whether increasing the mean of the
random variable increases, decreases, or has no effect on the value of the coefficient
of variation:
(a) Poisson with mean 
(b) exponential with mean 
(c) chi-square with n degrees of freedom [6]
\end{enumerate}
\newpage

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
8 (a) Mean = variance =  so c.o.v. = / = 1/
C.o.v. decreases as mean increases
(b) Mean = standard deviation =  so c.o.v. = 1
C.o.v. is unaffected by increasing the mean
(c) Mean = n, variance = 2n so c.o.v. = (2n)1/2/n = (2/n)1/2
C.o.v. decreases as mean increases
