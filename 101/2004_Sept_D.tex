The following data refer to an outbreak of botulism, a form of food poisoning that
may be fatal. Each subject is a person who contracted botulism in the outbreak. The
variables recorded are the subject s age in years, the time in hours between eating the
infected food and the first signs of illness (incubation period) and whether the subject
survived (denoted by survival category Y) or died (denoted by survival category N).

\item  (ii)
Construct suitable dotplots to investigate any relationship between:

and make a brief informal comparison of the died and survived groups based
on these dotplots.
\item (iii)
Construct 95% and 99% confidence intervals for the mean difference between
the incubation period for subjects who survived and subjects who died (i.e.
take the mean incubation period for subjects who survived minus the mean
incubation period for subjects who died).
Comment briefly on these confidence intervals.

\item 13
For each of a group of policyholders the number of claims, Y, occurring in a period of
one year is modelled by the following modified Poisson random variable, which
incorporates a reluctance to claim:
there is a probability of that Y equals zero and a probability of (1
comes from a Poisson distribution with mean , so that
P ( Y = 0) =
(1
P ( Y = r ) = (1
) that Y
) P ( X = 0)
) P ( X = r ), r = 1, 2,3,
where X ~ Poisson( ).
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i)
Show that the mean and variance of Y are given by
E ( Y ) (1
V ( Y ) (1
)
) (1
)
and comment briefly on these values in comparison to those for the
unmodified Poisson variable, X.
[5]
\item (ii) A random sample of such policyholders resulted in a distribution of numbers
of claims with sample mean y and sample standard deviation s. Use the
method of moments to determine estimators for and in terms of y and s 2 .
[4]
\item (iii) Data on the numbers of claims from a sample of 200 policyholders resulted in
the following frequency distribution.

Consider the following data, which comprise four groups of claim sizes (y), each
comprising four observations. In scenario I, information is also given on the sum
assured under the policy concerned the sum assured is the same for all four
policies in a group. In scenario II, we regard the policies in the different groups as
having been issued by four different companies
the policies in a group are all
issued by the same company.
All monetary amounts are in units of Â£10,000. Summaries of the claim sizes in each
group are given in a second table.

group 1 (namely 0.11) and the last claim size of group 4 (namely 4.08).
\item (c) Consider a test of the hypothesis H 0 : = 0 against a two-sided
alternative. By performing appropriate calculations, assess the strength
of the evidence against this no linear relationship hypothesis.

(the people who survived tended to have longer incubation periods), but do not
suggest an association between survival and age.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The 95\% confidence interval does not contain zero, therefore a two-sided, two
sample t-test conducted at the 5\% significance level would conclude that there
is a difference between the means of the two populations.
\item However, as the 99\% confidence interval does contain zero, conducting a
more stringent 1\% level t-test would not reject the null hypothesis that the
population means are the same.
\end{itemize}

(iv)
(a)
Assuming that the variances of the two populations are equal,
S 1 2 / S 2 2 ~ F n 1 1, n 2 1 .
s 1 2 / s 2 2
23.266 2 /12.563 2
3.430
The value of the test statistic is below the 5% significance level critical
value of F 6,10 (2.5%) = 4.072. This indicates that there is insufficient
evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the two populations have
equal variances.
(b)
In part (iii) an assumption of normality of each sample was required.
The dotplots suggest that this assumption is valid.
Also, the assumption of equal variances of the two groups seems valid
from the result of the test conducted in part (iv)(a).

E(Y) < E(X) as expected since there are more values equal to zero in the
adjusted distribution.
The original Poisson has V(X) = E(X). Here, with the extra zeros, we get
greater variability relative to the mean, as we see in the fact that V(Y) > E(Y).
