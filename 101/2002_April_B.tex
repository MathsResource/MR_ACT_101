\begin{enumerate}

\item  A magazine claims that 25% of its readers are students. A random sample of 200
readers is taken and is found to contain 42 students.
Calculate the probability of obtaining 42 or fewer student readers, assuming that the magazines claim is correct. [3]
\item  The percentage return on an investment of a particular type over a period of one year is to be modelled as a normal random variable X with mean  and variance 1. A
potential investor is interested in the chance that the return on such an investment will
exceed 9%.
A random sample of ten such returns have values
7.3, 8.9, 8.3, 6.2, 9.8, 7.7, 9.4 , 7.9, 9.1, and 7.4 .
Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of  = P(X > 9). [3]

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let X denote the number of magazine readers in the sample of 200 who are students.
\item Assuming the magazines claim is correct, X ~ binomial (200, 0.25).
\item Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution,
X ~ N(50, 150/4) approximately:
P(X  42)  42.5 50
(150 / 4)
P Z

where Z ~ N(0, 1)
= P(Z < 1.225) = 0.110 (using continuity correction).
\end{itemize}


4 Data sum = 82; MLE of  is  = x = 82 /10 = 8.2
 = P(X  9) = P(Z  9  ) where Z ~ N(0, 1)
 MLE of  = P(Z  9  ) = P(Z > 9  8.2) = P(Z > 0.8) = 0.212
