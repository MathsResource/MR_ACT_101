\begin{enumerate}
\item A random sample of insurance policies on the contents of private houses written
by each of three companies was examined and the sum insured (y) under each
policy noted. The results are summarised below (in units of £100).

For all 37 observations: Σy = 4302 , Σy2 = 521662 .
Consider the model
= , =1,2,3 Yij μ + τi + eij i ; j =1,2,...,ni

where Yij is the jth sum insured for company i, ni is the number of responses
available for company i, the ij e are independent normal variables, each with zero
mean and variance σ2, and 0 i i
% i
% n τ = .

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) Calculate the values of the least squares/maximum likelihood estimates of
μ and τi , i = 1, 2, 3. 
\item Perform an analysis of variance to investigate whether real differences
exist among the means of the sums insured under such policies issued by
the three companies. [5]
\end{enumerate}

%%(i) Estimate of μ = 4302/37 = 116.27

\begin{itemize}
\item Estimate of $\mu = 4302/37 = 116.27$
\item Estimate of $\tau_1 = 115.13 − 116.27 = −1.14$;
\item estimate of $\tau_2 = 95.00 − 116.27 = −21.27$;
\item estimate of $\tau_3 = 135.42 − 116.27 = 19.15$
\end{itemize}

(ii) Total SS = 521662 − 43022/37 = 21467.3
Model (Explained) SS = 15(115.132) + 10(952) + 12(135.422) − 43022/37
= 8942.0 **
∴Error SS = 21467.3 − 8942.0 = 12525.3 **
\begin{itemize}
    \item F = (8942.0/2)/(12525.3/34) = 12.1 on 2,34 degrees of freedom
\item Upper 1% point for F2,34 ≈ 5.3 so here P-value << 0.01
\item Overwhelming evidence against hypothesis H0 : τi = 0 , i = 1,2,3.
\item We conclude that real differences do exist : there is a company effect.
\item [** OR: Error SS = (14 × 196.41) + (9 × 341.33) + (11 × 609.36) = 12524.7
\item therefore Model SS = 21467.3 − 12524.7 = 8942.6]
