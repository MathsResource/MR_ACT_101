\item Two independent random samples of sizes n1 and n2 are selected from a normal
population with variance $\sigma^2$. The sample variances are denoted by $S^2_1$ and $S^2_2$
respectively. Let $S^2_W$ denote a weighted average of the sample variances given by
\[ S^2_W = \alpha S^2_1 + (1 - \alpha)S^2_2\]
where $\alpha$ is a constant such that $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that $S^2_W$
 is an unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$, and obtain an expression for
the mean square error of $S^2_W$
 .
(You may use
${ \displaystyle \operatorname{Var}(S^2_i)  = \frac{2 \sigma^4}{n_i - 1} }$ 

, i = 1, 2.) 
\item Show that $S^2_W$
 has minimum mean square error if ${ \displaystyle  \alpha = \frac{n_1 - 1}{ n_1 + n_2 - 2} }$
\end{enumerate}

\item 10 The number of incomplete insurance proposals Y, in a batch of x proposals, is to
be modelled as a Poisson random variable with mean $\lambda x$, where $\lambda$ is unknown.
Data are available from n independent batches of proposals as follows: batch
number i contains xi proposals of which yi are incomplete, $i = 1,2, \ldots, n$.
The least squares estimator of $\lambda$ is that value of $\lambda$for which
\[( )2

\item Determine $\hat{lambda}$ , the maximum likelihood estimator of $\lambda$. 
\item Determine whether neither, one, or both of $\lambda$ and $\hat{lambda}$ provide unbiased
estimators of $\lambda$.

\begin{eqnarray*}
E ( S_W^2 ) \\
&=& \alpha E ( S^2_1 ) + (1 - \alpha ) E ( S^2 )\\
&=& \alpha \sigma^2 + (1 - \alpha)\sigma^2 \\
&=& \sigma^2(using unbiasedness of sample variance)\\
\end{eqnarray*}

Therefore $S^2_W$ is unbiased for $\sigma^2$ . 

$MSE = Var ( S_W )$ since unbiased.

\begin{eqnarray*}
\operatorname{MSE} &=& Var ( S^2_W ) \\
&=& \alpha^2 Var ( S^2_1 ) + (1 - \alpha )^2 \operatorname{Var} ( S^2 )\\
&=& 2\sigma^4 \left(  \frac{\alpha^2}{n_1 \;-\;1}  + \frac{(1 - \alpha )^2}{n_2-1} \right)\\
\end{eqnarray*}

using \[ \operatorname{Var}(S^2_i) \;=\; \frac{2\sigma^4 }{n_1 \;-\;1} , i= 1,2 \]

%------------------------%

\[
\frac{ d\operatorname{MSE}}{d \alpha} 
\;=\; 2\sigma^4 \left(  \frac{2\alpha}{n_1 \;-\;1}  + \frac{-2(1 - \alpha )}{n_2-1} \right)\\

estimators could produce different estimators.
