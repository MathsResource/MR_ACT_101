\item 12 In 1998 a market research organisation conducted a survey in a large city. A
random sample of 400 households showed that 68 were such that at least one
person in the household was a member of a health/fitness club.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  An estimate of the true proportion of households in the city with at least
one person being a member of a health/fitness club is therefore
68
400
= 0.17. Calculate 95\% confidence limits for the true proportion.
\item A similar survey was conducted in 1999 and a random sample of 400
households showed that 80 were such that at least one person in the
household was a member of a health/fitness club.
Perform a one-sided test to investigate whether the true proportion
increased from 1998 to 1999. In particular determine the p-value of the
test and state your conclusion. 
\end{enumerate}

There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is an increase in the
true proportion. The observed difference could have occurred by chance.
