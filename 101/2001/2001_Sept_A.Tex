\item 1 Data were collected on 100 consecutive days for the number of claims, x, arising
from a group of policies. This resulted in the following frequency distribution
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
x: & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & $\geq 5$ \\
f: & 14 & 25 & 26 & 18 &  12 & 5 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Calculate the median and interquartile range for these data. 



\end{enumerate}

\newpage

1 n = 100. So median =

th observation = 2
Q1 =

25
2
th observation = 1
Q3 =
1
75
2
th observation = 3 -IQR = 3 - 1 = 2

\newpage 2 Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be independent Poisson random variables with respective means $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$.
Assuming the moment generating function of a Poisson random variable, determine the moment generating function of $X_1 + X_2$ and hence state the distribution of $X_1 + X_2$ .
