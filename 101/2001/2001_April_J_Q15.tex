15 It has been decided to model a claim amount distribution using a gamma
distribution with parameters $\alpha = 4$ and $\lambda$ (unknown), that is, with density
\[f(x; \lambda ) =
1
6
λ4 x3 e−λx: 0 < x < ∞.\]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item (i) A random sample of n claim amounts, X1, X2,\ldots , Xn, is selected and it is
required to estimate the parameter λ.
(a) (1) Determine the method of moments estimator of $\lambda$.
\item (2) Show that the maximum likelihood estimator of $\lambda$ is the same as the method of moments estimator.
\item (b) (1) Write down the moment generating function of Xi and
derive the moment generating function of Y = 2nλX , where X is the sample mean. Explain why the distribution of Y
is 28
χ n .
\item (2) Using Y = 2nλX as a pivotal quantity, derive a 95\% confidence interval for λ. 
(ii) A random sample of 10 claim amounts yields a sample mean of x = £242
and a standard deviation of s = £112.
(a) Using part (i), calculate a 95% confidence interval for λ.
\item (b) (1) Use the Central Limit theorem to obtain an approximate
95% confidence interval for the population mean.
\item (2) Calculate this confidence interval and convert it into an
approximate confidence interval for $\lambda$.
\item (3) Comment briefly on the comparison of this interval with
that obtained in part (ii)(a). 
\end{enumerate}

\item  The table below gives data on the lean body mass (the weight without fat) and
resting metabolic rate for twelve women who were the subjects in a study of
obesity. The researchers suspected that metabolic rate is related to lean body
mass.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) Draw a scatter plot of the resting metabolic rate against lean body mass and comment briefly on any relationship.
   \item (ii) Calculate the least squares fit regression line in which resting metabolic rate is modelled as the response and the lean body mass as the explanatory variable. 
   \item (iii) Determine a 95\% confidence interval for the slope coefficient of the model.
State any assumptions made. 
   \item (iv) Use the fitted model to construct 95\% confidence intervals for the mean resting metabolic rate when:
(a) the lean body mass is 50kg
(b) the lean body mass is 75kg 
   \item (v) Comment on the appropriateness of each of the confidence intervals given
in (iv).
