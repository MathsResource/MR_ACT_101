4 Let $\{(x_i , y_i); i = 1, \ldots , n\}$ denote a set of n pairs of points with Assuming the usual expressions for the estimated coefficients, verify that the least squares fitted regression line of y on x passes through the point $(x, y)$. 

\medskip 
4 Fitted regression line:
% y = - \lambda x
% But least squares estimate of  is
% - \lambda y  x.
% Therefore y - y \lambda x  x - y  (x \lambda x )
% - y \lambda y when x \lambda x. Hence line passes through point -x, y\lambda.
