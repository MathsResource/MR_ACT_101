\item 15 In a study into employee share ownership plans, data were obtained from ten
large insurance companies on the following two variables:
employee satisfaction with the plan (x);
employee commitment to the company (y).
For each company a random sample (of the same size) of employees completed
questionnaires in which satisfaction and commitment were recorded on a 110
scale, with 1 representing low satisfaction/commitment and 10 representing high
satisfaction/commitment. The resulting means provide each companys
employees satisfaction and commitment score. These scores are given in the
following table:
Co. A B C D E F G H I J
x 5.05 4.12 5.38 4.17 3.81 4.47 5.41 4.88 4.64 5.19
y 5.36 4.59 5.42 4.35 4.03 5.34 5.64 4.89 4.52 5.88
% x = 47.12, x2 = 224.8554, y = 50.02, y2 = 253.5796, xy = 238.3676
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Draw a scatterplot of y against x and comment briefly on any relationship
between employee satisfaction and commitment. 
\item Calculate the fitted linear regression equation of y on x. 
\item Calculate the coefficient of determination R2 and relate its value to your
comment . 
\item Assuming the full normal model, calculate an estimate of the error
variance $\sigma^2$ and obtain a 95\% confidence interval for $\sigma^2$. 
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the true underlying slope
coefficient. 
\item For companies with an employees satisfaction score of 5.0, calculate an
estimate of the expected employees commitment score together with 95%
confidence limits. 
\end{enumerate}
