\begin{enumerate}
\item 5 Consider a random sample of size n from a normal distribution N(,2) and let $S^2$
denote the sample variance.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) State the sampling distribution for

, and specify an approximate
sampling distribution for this expression when n is large. 
    \item ) For n = 101 calculate an approximate value for the probability that S2 exceeds
2 by more than a factor of 10\%, i.e. P(S2 > 1.1 2). 
[Total 3]
\end{enumerate}


\item 6 Calculate the maximum possible width of a symmetrical two-sided 95% confidence
interval for the proportion of a population who possess a particular characteristic,
based on the corresponding information in a random sample of size 1600 from the
population. [3]

\item 7 A group of 500 insurance policies gave rise to a total of 83 claims during the last year.
Assuming a Poisson model for the occurrence of claims, calculate an approximate
95\% confidence interval for , the claim rate per policy per year. 

\item 8 The ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of a random variable is called the
coefficient of variation.
For each of the following distributions, decide whether increasing the mean of the
random variable increases, decreases, or has no effect on the value of the coefficient
of variation:
(a) Poisson with mean 
(b) exponential with mean 
(c) chi-square with n degrees of freedom [6]
\end{enumerate}

8 (a) Mean = variance =  so c.o.v. = / = 1/
C.o.v. decreases as mean increases
(b) Mean = standard deviation =  so c.o.v. = 1
C.o.v. is unaffected by increasing the mean
(c) Mean = n, variance = 2n so c.o.v. = (2n)1/2/n = (2/n)1/2
C.o.v. decreases as mean increases
