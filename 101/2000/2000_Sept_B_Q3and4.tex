\item 3 The number of claims arising in a period of one month from a group of policies
can be modelled by a Poisson distribution with mean 24.
Determine the probability that fewer than 20 claims arise in a particular month.

3 Can get answer directly from Green tables:
\[P(X < 20) = P(X \leq 19) = 0.18026 = 0.18\]
OR: use normal approximation with continuity correction.
$X \sim  N(24, \sqrt{24}^2 )$

$P(X < 20) \rightarrow P(X < 19.5)$

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(X < 19.5) &=& P \left( Z < \frac{19.5-24}{\sqrt{24}} \right) \\ 
&=& P\left(Z \leq -0.92 \right) \\
&=&  1 âˆ’ 0.82 \\
&=&  0.18.\\
\end{eqnarray*}
(Note: without continuity correction answer is 0.15)

4 Suppose that a random sample of nine observations is taken from a normal
distribution with mean $\mu = 0$. \begin{itemize}
    \item Let $X$ and $S^2$ denote the sample mean and
variance respectively.
\item Determine (to 2 decimal places) the probability that the value of X exceeds that of $S$, i.e. determine $P( X > S)$ . 
\end{itemize}

4 $\mu = 0$, n = 9 so $X / (S / 3) \sim t_8$ so $P( X > S) = P(t_8 > 3) $,
which, from tables, is just less than 0.01
(actually 0.0085, but not needed for the marks)
