It is thought that P and L satisfy the law P = k/L where k is a constant, so
log P = log k - log L, i.e. Y = log k - X.
A graph of log P against log L is included.
The simple linear regression model y = a + bx has been fitted to the data, and
the fitted values and residuals are recorded in the table above.
(i) Use the data summaries above to calculate the least squares estimates
% $ a of a and ˆb of b . 
(ii) Assuming the usual normal linear regression model

\begin{enumerate}
\item estimate the error variance $s^2$,
\item calculate a 95\% confidence interval for b, and
\item discuss briefly whether the data are consistent with the
relationship P = k L . 
\end{enumerate}

(iii) Plot the residuals of the model against X and comment on the
information contained in the plot.

    \item (ii) (a) The sum of squares of the residuals is 0.049019, so 2 is estimated
by the residual mean square 0.049019

\item (b) The estimated variance of ˆ is 0.004456

This leads to the following 95\% confidence interval for :
1.289  2.201 0.00189 = (1.384, 1.193).
\item (c) If the relationship P = k/L is correct the slope parameter of the
regression line should be –1. As the upper end of the interval is
less than –1, the data do not support the suggested relationship.
\item (iii)
The residuals show that the line underfits in the centre. A straight line
doesn’t fit the data very well.
