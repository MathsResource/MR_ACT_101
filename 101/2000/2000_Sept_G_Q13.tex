\item 13 Consider a one-way analysis of variance for comparing k treatments using the
same number ni = r responses for each treatment. The model is
\[Yij = \mu + τi + e_{ij} : i = 1, 2, ..., k; j = 1,2, ..., r\]
where the errors eij are independent $N(0, \sigma 2)$ random variables and where $\sum τi = 0$.
Show that the parameter estimates $\hat{\mu}$ = Y⋅⋅ and ˆi τ = i Y⋅ −Y⋅⋅ are unbiased and
that their variances are given by

$V(\hat{\mu} ) = V(\bar{Y}_{\ldot \ldot} ) =

\frac{\sigma^2}{kr}$


as $\bar{Y}_{\ldot \ldot}$ is mean of kr r.v.’s each with $var(\sigma2)$.

\begin{eqnarray*}
V( \hat{\tau}}_i) 
&=& V(\bar{Y}_{i \ldot} −\bar{Y}_{\ldot \ldot}) \\
&=& V(\bar{Y}_{i \ldot}) + V (\bar{Y}_{\ldot \ldot}) − Cov (\bar{Y}_{\ldot}, \bar{Y}_{\ldot \ldot}) \\
&=& \frac{\sigma^2}{r} + \frac{\sigma^2}{kr} - 2 \frac{1}{r} \frac{1}{kr} r \sigma^2 \\
&=& \frac{\sigma^2}{r} + \frac{\sigma^2}{kr} - 2 \left(\frac{\sigma^2}{kr} \right) \\
&=& \frac{\sigma^2}{r} - \frac{\sigma^2}{kr} \\
&=& \frac{(k-1)\sigma^2}{kr} \\
\end{eqnarray}

Alternative method:
( ) i V \bar{Y}_{\ldot} −\bar{Y}_{\ldot \ldot} =


V\left(  \left( 1 - \frac{1}{k}  \right) \bar{Y}_{i}  - \frac{1}{k} \sum_{j \neq i} \bar{Y}_{j} \right)
&=& \left(1 - \frac{1}{k} \right) \frac{\sigma^2}{r}  + \left(- \frac{1}{k} \right)^2 \frac{(k-1)\sigma^2}{r} \\

&=& \frac{\sigma^2}{k^2r} \left[  (k-1)^2 + (k-1) \right] \\
&=& \frac{(k-1)\sigma^2}{kr} \\
\end{eqnarray}

( ) i E Y⋅ E(μˆ ) = E(Y⋅⋅ ) = μ Therefore unbiased
(ˆ ) i E τ = ( ) i E Y⋅ −Y⋅⋅ = μ + τi − μ = τi Therefore unbiased
