\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose that the distribution of a physical coefficient, X, can be modelled
using a uniform distribution on (0, 1). A researcher is interested in the
distribution of Y, an adjusted form of the reciprocal of the coefficient, where Y
= (1 / X) - 1.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that the probability density function of Y is given by
fY(y) = 1/(1 + y)2 , y > 0 
\item Show that the mean of Y does not exist. 
\end{enumerate}

%%- Question 13


\begin{eqnarray*}
F_Y(y) &=& P(Y < y) \\
&=& P( \frac{1}{x} < y+1 }\\
&=& P(X > \frac{1}{y+1}) \\
&=& 1 - \frac{1}{y+1}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{eqnarray*}
E(Y) &=& \int^{\infty}_{0} y(1+y)^{-2} dy \\
&=& \int^{\infty}_{0} (1+y)^{-1} dy  -  \int^{\infty}_{0} (1+y)^{-2} dy \\
\end{eqnarray*}

(i) 
\begin{eqnarray*} F Y (y) &=& P(Y < y) \\ 
&=& P(\frac{1}{X} < y + 1) \\ 
&=& P[X > \frac{1}{(y + 1)}] \\ 
&=& 1 - \frac{1}{y + 1}\\ 
\end{eqnarray*}

so 
\begin{eqnarray*}
f_Y (y) 
&=& \frac{d}{dy} \left( F_Y  \right) \\ 
&=& \frac{1}{(y + 1)^2} , \mbox{ where } y > 0\\
\end{eqnarray*}

(ii) \[E(Y) = \int^{\infty}_{0} y(1+y)^{-2} dy \]

\begin{framed}
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $y+1 = u$ and consequently $y = u-1$
\item $du = dy$
\end{itemize}
\[\int\frac{u-1}{u^2} dy = \int\frac{1}{u} dy + \int\frac{1}{u^2} dy\]

\end{framed}

\[E(Y) = \int^{\infty}_{0} (1+y)^{-1} dy  + \int^{\infty}_{0} (1+y)^{-2} dy  \]

\[E(Y) = \left[ \log(1+y) - \frac{1}{1+y} \right]^{\infty}_{0}\]



The integral of $(1 + y)^{-1}$ gives $\log(1 + y)$ which approaches infty as y approaches infinity so this
integral is not finite. So $E(Y)$ does not exist.

\item An insurance company issues house buildings policies for houses of similar
size in four different post-code regions A, B, C and D.
\begin{itemize}
\item  An insurance agent takes independent random samples of 10 house
buildings policies for houses of similar size in regions A and B.
\item The
annual premiums (\$) were as follows:

\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}\hline
Region A: & 229 241 270 256 241 247 261 243 272 219
& (Sx = 2,479 ; Sx2 = 617,163)\\  \hline
Region B: & 261 269 284 268 249 255 237 270 269 257
& (Sx = 2,619 ; Sx2 = 687,467)\\  \hline
\end{tabular}   
\end{center}

\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Perform a two-sample t-test at the 5\% level to compare the
premiums for these two regions.
\item Present the data in a simple diagram and hence comment briefly
on the validity of the assumptions required for the above t-test.
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the underlying common
standard deviation s of such premiums. 
\end{enumerate}
%------------------------%
(ii) The agent takes further independent random samples of 10 such
policies from the other two regions C and D. The annual premiums
were as follows:
\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}\hline
Region C: & 253 247 244 245 221 229 245 256 232 269
& (Sx = 2,441 ; Sx2 = 597,607)\\  \hline
Region D:&  279 268 290 245 281 262 287 257 262 246
& (Sx = 2,677 ; Sx2 = 718,973)\\  \hline
\end{tabular}   
\end{center}


\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Perform a one-way analysis of variance at the 5\% level to
compare the premiums for all four regions.
\item Present the new data in a simple diagram and hence comment
briefly on the validity of the assumptions required for the
analysis of variance.
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the underlying common
standard deviation $s$ of such premiums in the four regions. 
(iii) Comment briefly on your two confidence intervals in (i) and (ii)
above.
