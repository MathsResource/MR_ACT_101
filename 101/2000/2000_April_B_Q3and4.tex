\noindent In an investigation into the proportion ($\theta$) of lapses in the first year of a
certain type of policy, the uncertainty about q is modelled by taking $\theta$ to have a
beta distribution with parameters a = 1 and b = 9, that is, with density
\[f(\theta) = 9(1 - \theta)^8 : 0 < \theta < 1.\]
Using this distribution, calculate the probability that $\theta$ exceeds 0.2. 


{

\begin{eqnarray*}
P(\theta > 0.2) &=& \int^{1}_{0.2} 9(1- \theta)^8) d \theta \\
& & \\
&=& \left[ -(1-\theta)^9  \right]^{1}_{0.2}\\
& & \\
&=& 0 + (1 - 0.2)^9 \\ 
&=& 0.8^9 \\
&=& 0.13\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\newpage
Consider the following three probability statements concerning an F variable
with 6 and 12 degrees of freedom.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P(F6,12 > 0.250) = 0.95$
\item $P(F6,12 < 4.821) = 0.99$
\item $P(F6,12 < 0.130) = 0.01$
\end{enumerate}

State, with reasons, whether each of these statements is true. 


4 
\begin{itemize}
\item For (a) to be true, 0.250 must be lower 5\% pt of F6,12 i.e. reciprocal of upper 5\% pt
of F12,6 which is
1
4.000
= 0.250  true.
    \item For (b) to be true, 4.821 must be upper 1\% pt of F6,12 which is 4.821 true.
\item For (c) to be true, 0.130 must be lower 1\% pt of F6,12 i.e. reciprocal of upper 1\% pt
of F12,6 which is
1
7.718
= 0.130 true.

\end{itemize}
