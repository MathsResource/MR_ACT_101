\item Sickness and absence records were kept on 30 employees in a company over a 91-day
period. These data are tabulated below:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
Number of employees absent & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5\\
Number of days & 44 & 19 & 10 & 8 & 7 & 3 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation of the number of employees absent
per day. [3]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item A set of claim amounts (Â£) is given below:
\begin{verbatim}
    192 136 253 138 87
112 221 176 336 203
159 55 308 165 254
\end{verbatim}

Present these data graphically using a boxplot.
