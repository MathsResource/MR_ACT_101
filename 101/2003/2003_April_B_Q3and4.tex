\begin{document} The probability that a car accident is due to faulty brakes is 0.02, the probability that a
car accident is correctly attributed to faulty brakes is 0.95, and the probability that a car accident is incorrectly attributed to faulty brakes is 0.01.

Calculate the probability that a car accident which is attributed to faulty brakes was
due to faulty brakes.

4 The probability that information held on an individual record on a company's
database is incorrect (e.g. information is out-of-date) is 0.13.
Calculate the probability that in a random sample of 200 records at most 20 contain
incorrect information.
\newpage
4 Let X be the number of records with incorrect information.
\[X \sim binomial(200, 0.13)\]
\[X \sim  N((200)(0.13), 200(0.13)(0.87)) \]
i.e. N(26, 22.62)

\[ P(X < 20) = \frac{20.5 - 26}{22.62}\]
