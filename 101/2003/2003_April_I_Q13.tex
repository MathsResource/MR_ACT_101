13 The random variable, X, has a gamma distribution with probability density function

where $m$ and $\beta$ are positive constants. This distribution has mean $m\beta$ and variance
m2. Let $x_1, \ldots , x_n$ denote a random sample of n observations on X.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) Suppose that m is known.
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
 \item (a) Show that the maximum likelihood estimate of $\beta$ is given by
1
Âˆ / . n
i i x mn

 
 \item  (b) Show that $\hat{\beta}$ is an unbiased estimator of $\beta$.
 \item  (c) Obtain the Cramer-Rao lower bound for estimators of $\beta$.
 \item (d) Show that the maximum likelihood estimator of $\beta$ has variance equal to the lower bound given in (i)(c). 
 \\ \medskip
Suppose now that m is unknown, and is also to be estimated by maximum likelihood. It is assumed that m is large enough so that $\Gamma(m)$ is well approximated by
\[g(m) exp( m)m(m 0.5) (2 )0.5 \]
   .
\end{enumerate}
    \item (ii) Determine the approximate maximum likelihood estimates of $\beta$ and $m$, substituting g(m) for $\Gamma(m)$ in the likelihood function. 
    \item (iii) Suppose that the sample values are:
\[32 48 51 43 82 155\]
Obtain the approximate maximum likelihood estimates for $\beta$ and $m$ given in (ii). 
\end{enumerate}
