\begin{enumerate}
\item 5 Consider a random sample of size n from a normal distribution N(,2) and let $S^2$
denote the sample variance.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) State the sampling distribution for

, and specify an approximate
sampling distribution for this expression when n is large. 
    \item ) For n = 101 calculate an approximate value for the probability that S2 exceeds
2 by more than a factor of 10\%, i.e. P(S2 > 1.1 2). 
[Total 3]
\end{enumerate}


\item 6 Calculate the maximum possible width of a symmetrical two-sided 95% confidence
interval for the proportion of a population who possess a particular characteristic,
based on the corresponding information in a random sample of size 1600 from the
population. [3]
