Calculate the maximum possible width of a symmetrical two-sided 95% confidence
interval for the proportion of a population who possess a particular characteristic,
based on the corresponding information in a random sample of size 1600 from the
population.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Approximate CI is observed proportion  {1.96  standard error}
\item Maximum value of s.e. is 0.5/1600 = 0.0125
\item so maximum width of CI = 2  1.96  0.0125 = 0.049
\end{itemize}
