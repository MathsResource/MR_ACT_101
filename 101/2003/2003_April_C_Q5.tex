%%-Question 5 
\large
\noindent Consider a random sample of size n from a normal distribution $N( \mu, \sigma^2)$ and let $S^2$
denote the sample variance.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item  State the sampling distribution for
${ \displaystyle \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} }$
, and specify an approximate
sampling distribution for this expression when $n$ is large. 
    \item For $n = 101$ calculate an approximate value for the probability that $S^2$ exceeds
$\sigma^2$ by more than a factor of 10\%, i.e. $P(S^2 > 1.1 \sigma^2)$. 

\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Solutions}\\

\large
\noindent The $\chi^2$, or chi-square, distribution (with degrees of freedom $\nu$) has the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The mean of the distribution is equal to the number of degrees of freedom: $\mu = \nu$. 
    \item The variance is equal to two times the number of degrees of freedom: $\sigma^2 = 2\nu$.
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}
\large 
\medskip 
\noindent \textbf{Part (a)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ${ \displaystyle \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} } \sim \chi^2_{n-1}$

\item ${ \displaystyle \frac{(n-1)S^2}{\sigma^2} } \approx N \left(n-1,2(n-1) \right)$ for large $n$
\end{itemize}

\medskip 
\noindent \textbf{Part (a)}

\[P \left(  \frac{100 S^2}{\sigma^2} > 110 \right)
\approx P \left( Z > \frac{110-100}{\sqrt{200}} = 0.707 \right)  = 1-0.76=0.24 \]
