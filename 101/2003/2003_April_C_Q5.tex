%%-Question 5 
Consider a random sample of size n from a normal distribution N(,2) and let $S^2$
denote the sample variance.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item  State the sampling distribution for

, and specify an approximate
sampling distribution for this expression when n is large. 
    \item ) For n = 101 calculate an approximate value for the probability that S2 exceeds
2 by more than a factor of 10\%, i.e. P(S2 > 1.1 2). 

\end{enumerate}
