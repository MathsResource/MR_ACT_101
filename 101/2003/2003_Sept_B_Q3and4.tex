\item 3 A random sample of size 200 is taken from a large group of motor policies. The
proportion of policies on which claims arose during the last year is ˆ  0.16 .
Calculate approximate 95\% confidence limits for the true proportion  for the whole
group of policies. 
\item 4 A random sample of 16 values, $x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_{16}$, was drawn from a normal population
and gave the following summary statistics:

\begin{itemize}

\item $n=16$

\item ${  \displaystyle  \sum^{16}_{i=1} x_i = 51.2 }$ and ${  \displaystyle  \sum^{16}_{i=1} x_i^2 = 243.19 }$

\item $\bar{x} =3.20 $

\item ${  \displaystyle s^2  = \frac{243.19 - \frac{(51.2)^2}{16}}{16-1}   = \frac{79.35}{15} = 5.29 }$

\item $ s = \sqrt{5.29} = 2.3$.
