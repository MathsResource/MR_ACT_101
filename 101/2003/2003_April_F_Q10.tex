\begin{document}

10 In an investigation into the comparison of claim amounts between three different
regions, a random sample of 10 independent claim amounts was taken from each
region and an analysis of variance was performed. The resulting ANOVA table is
given below with some entries omitted:
\begin{verbatim}
Source of variation d.f. SS MSS
Between regions 2 4439.7 2219.9
Residual * * *
Total 29 15153.2    
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) Calculate the missing entries in this table and perform the appropriate F-test to
determine whether there are significant differences between the mean claim
amounts for the three regions. 
    \item (ii) The three sample means were given by:
Region A B C
Sample mean 147.47 154.56 125.95
Given that it was of particular interest to compare regions A and B, calculate a
95\% confidence interval for the difference in their means and comment on
your answer in the light of the F-test performed in part (i). 
\end{enumerate}

10 (i) Missing entries are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item d.f. = 27 by subtraction
    \item SS = 10713.5 by subtraction
    \item MS = 396.8 being 10713.5/27.
    \item Observed F = 5.59 on 2 and 27 d.f.
    \item From tables the 1\% critical point is 5.488
    \item Significant at 1\%, so there is quite strong evidence of a difference in the mean
claim amounts for the three regions.
\end{itemize}

(ii) 95% confidence interval for (A  B ) , or equivalently (A  B ) , is
0.025,27

	\begin{itemize}
    \item
This comfortably contains zero indicating no difference between the
underlying means for regions A and B.
\item The significant result of the F-test clearly comes from region C mean being
much lower than the region A and B means.
\end{itemize}
