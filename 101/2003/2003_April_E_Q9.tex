\begin{document}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 9 An insurance company specifies in its advertising literature that 75% of all small
claims (less than £200) on household policies are fully settled within one month. As
part of an internal audit a random sample of 200 small claims is examined.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item It is found that 146 of these small claims were fully settled within one month.
Obtain an approximate one-sided 99% confidence interval for the true
percentage of all small claims which are fully settled within one month. 
\item (ii) The mean and standard deviation of the individual claim amounts were
calculated as x  £112.41and s = £51.62 respectively. Obtain an approximate
two-sided 99\% confidence interval for the population mean of all small claim
amounts. [2]
