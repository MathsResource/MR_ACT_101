\item 9 An insurance company specifies in its advertising literature that 75% of all small
claims (less than Â£200) on household policies are fully settled within one month. As
part of an internal audit a random sample of 200 small claims is examined.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item It is found that 146 of these small claims were fully settled within one month.
Obtain an approximate one-sided 99% confidence interval for the true
percentage of all small claims which are fully settled within one month. 
\item (ii) The mean and standard deviation of the individual claim amounts were
calculated as x  Â£112.41and s = Â£51.62 respectively. Obtain an approximate
two-sided 99\% confidence interval for the population mean of all small claim
amounts. [2]
\end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 10 In an investigation into the comparison of claim amounts between three different
regions, a random sample of 10 independent claim amounts was taken from each
region and an analysis of variance was performed. The resulting ANOVA table is
given below with some entries omitted:
Source of variation d.f. SS MSS
Between regions 2 4439.7 2219.9
Residual * * *
Total 29 15153.2
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) Calculate the missing entries in this table and perform the appropriate F-test to
determine whether there are significant differences between the mean claim
amounts for the three regions. [3]
    \item (ii) The three sample means were given by:
Region A B C
Sample mean 147.47 154.56 125.95
Given that it was of particular interest to compare regions A and B, calculate a
95% confidence interval for the difference in their means and comment on
your answer in the light of the F-test performed in part (i). [4]

\item 11 Let S  X1  X2 ... XN (and S = 0 if N = 0) where the Xi Â’s are independent and
identically distributed as exponential random variables with mean  and are also
independent of N, which has a Poisson distribution with mean .
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item i) Prove, from first principles (that is without quoting any general results for
compound distributions), that the moment generating function of S, MS(t), is
given by    ( ) = exp 1 1 1 MS t t        

\item (ii) Using the expression for the moment generating function of S in (i) (and
without quoting any general results for compound distributions), derive an
expression for the variance of S.

The usual two-sided 99% confidence interval for the proportion p would be
pÂˆ  2.58 s.e.( pÂˆ ) to pÂˆ  2.58 s.e.( pÂˆ )
Given the nature of the claim, the appropriate one-sided 99% confidence
interval for the proportion p is of the form (0, pU),
where 0.73 2.326 (0.73)(0.27) 0.73 0.073

10 (i) Missing entries are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item d.f. = 27 by subtraction
    \item SS = 10713.5 by subtraction
    \item MS = 396.8 being 10713.5/27.
    \item Observed F = 5.59 on 2 and 27 d.f.
    \item From tables the 1\% critical point is 5.488
    \item Significant at 1\%, so there is quite strong evidence of a difference in the mean
claim amounts for the three regions.
\end{itemize}

This comfortably contains zero indicating no difference between the
underlying means for regions A and B.
\item The significant result of the F-test clearly comes from region C mean being
much lower than the region A and B means.

11 (i) MS(t) = E[etS] = E[E(etS|N)]
E[etS|N=n] = E[exp{t(X1 + X2 +Â…+ Xn}|N=n]

 E[exp(tXi)] (since the XiÂ’s are iid)

 MS(t) = E[{MX(t)}N] = E[exp{NlogMX(t)}] = MN{logMX(t)}

Alternative solution using the cumulant generating function
Let CS(t) = logMS(t) = {(1 - t)-1 Â– 1}
CS (t) = (1 - t)-2 , CS(t) = 2(1 - t)-3
So E[S] = CS (0) =  and V[S] = CS(0) = 22
