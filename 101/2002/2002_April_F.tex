\item 10 A company wants to estimate the percentage of its customers who are willing to shop on the internet. It decides to do so by calculating a symmetrical 95\% two-sided confidence interval for the unknown percentage.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that, based on a random sample of 200 of the company's customers, the required confidence interval will have a width which is no greater than 13.9\%.

\item Calculate the sample size required which will ensure that, whatever the true percentage, the width of the confidence interval will be no greater than 10\%.
\end{enumerate}

Max value of P(1 - P) is 0.52 = 0.25
 Max width of CI = 2  1.96  (0.25/200)0.5 = 0.139
In terms of percentages, this is 13.9%.
