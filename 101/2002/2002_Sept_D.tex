\item 7 Suppose that $X$ is a continuous random variable uniformly distributed on $(0, 1)$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item  Show that the moment generating function of $Y = - \log X$ is
\[M_Y(t) = \frac{1}{1 - t} \mbox{ for } t < 1.\] 
    \item Hence state the distribution of $Y$. 
\end{enumerate}

(i)
\begin{eqnarray*}
M_Y( t ) &=& E ( e^{tY} ) \\ 
&=& E ( e^{t\log X} )
&=& E(X^{-t}) \\
&=& \int^{1}{0} x^{-t}\\
&=& \left[ \frac{x^{-t+1}}{1-t}\right]^{1}_{0} \\
&=& \left(  \frac{1^{-t+1}}{1-t}\right) - \left( \frac{xo{-t+1}}{1-t}\right)
&=& \frac{1}{1-t}, \mbox{ for } t < 1
\end{eqnarray*}

This is the MGF of an exponential distribution with parameter 1, and by
uniqueness for the MGF this then implies that $Y$ has this distribution.

$ \hat{\lambda} = \frac{183}{1500} = 0.122$
(ii) (a)
Number of claims X for 10 policies in six months is Poisson with
parameter $10(0.5)(0.122) = 0.61$
\[P(no claims) = P(X = 0) = exp(-0.61) = 0.543\]

\item 8 Assume that, for a group of insurance policies, the number of claims on each policy
can be modelled by a Poisson distribution with the same rate $\lambda$ per year,
independently for each policy. Such a group of 1500 policies gave rise to a total of
183 claims during the last year.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) State the value of the maximum likelihood estimate of $\lambda$.
\item (ii) Hence obtain estimates of the following quantities:
(a) The probability that a subset of 10 of these policies results in no claims
over the next six months.
(b) The probability that a subset of 250 of these policies results in more
than 40 claims over the next year.

\begin{itemize}
    \item (ii) (a) Number of claims X for 10 policies in six months is Poisson with
parameter 10(0.5)(0.122) = 0.61
\item P(no claims) = P(X = 0) = exp(	0.61) = 0.543
\item Alternative:
For a single policy P(no claim) = exp(	0.061) = 0.9408
For 10 policies P(no claims) = (0.9408)10 = 0.543
\item (b) Number of claims X for 250 policies in one year is Poisson with
parameter 250(0.122) = 30.5
\item Outwith scope of the Green tables, so we must use a normal
approximation:
X $\leq$ N(30.5,30.5)
\item Applying a continuity correction:
\end{itemize}

( 40) ( 40.5) = ( 40.5 30.5 =1.81) =1 0.96485
