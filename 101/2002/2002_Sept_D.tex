%%%----- Question 7 

Suppose that $X$ is a continuous random variable uniformly distributed on $(0, 1)$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item  Show that the moment generating function of $Y = - \log X$ is
\[M_Y(t) = \frac{1}{1 - t} \mbox{ for } t < 1.\] 
    \item Hence state the distribution of $Y$. 
\end{enumerate}

(i)
\begin{eqnarray*}
M_Y( t ) &=& E ( e^{tY} ) \\ 
&=& E ( e^{t\log X} )
&=& E(X^{-t}) \\
&=& \int^{1}{0} x^{-t}\\
&=& \left[ \frac{x^{-t+1}}{1-t}\right]^{1}_{0} \\
&=& \left(  \frac{1^{-t+1}}{1-t}\right) - \left( \frac{xo{-t+1}}{1-t}\right)
&=& \frac{1}{1-t}, \mbox{ for } t < 1
\end{eqnarray*}

This is the MGF of an exponential distribution with parameter 1, and by
uniqueness for the MGF this then implies that $Y$ has this distribution.

$ \hat{\lambda} = \frac{183}{1500} = 0.122$
(ii) (a)
Number of claims X for 10 policies in six months is Poisson with
parameter $10(0.5)(0.122) = 0.61$
\[P(no claims) = P(X = 0) = exp(-0.61) = 0.543\]
