\item  Six insurance companies were being compared with regard to premiums being
charged for house contents insurance for houses in a particular postcode region.
Independent random samples of five policies from each company are examined and
the premiums (in £) were recorded.

\end{verbatim}


\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Compute an ANOVA table for these data, and show that there are no
significant differences, at the 5\% level, between mean premiums being
charged by each company. 
\item State the assumptions required for the above analysis of variance, and, by
drawing a suitable diagram of these data, comment briefly on the validity of
these assumptions. 
\item Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the underlying common standard
deviation % , using 2
SSR

as a pivotal quantity with a %  2  distribution. 
\item A colleague points out that company C has the largest mean premium of
£165.20 and that Company B has the smallest mean premium of £131.40 and
suggests performing a t-test to compare these two companies.
(a) Perform this t-test, using the estimate of variance from the ANOVA
table, and in particular show that there is a significant difference at the
1\% level.
(b) Your colleague states that there is therefore a significant difference
between the six companies.
Discuss the apparent contradiction with your conclusion and
explain the flaw in your colleagues argument.

(b) There is no contradiction.
It is wrong to pick out the largest and the smallest of a set of treatment
means, test for significance, and then draw conclusions about the set.
% Even if H0 : is all equal is true, the largest and smallest sample
means would, of course, differ.
