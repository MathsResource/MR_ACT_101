The table below gives the frequency of coronary heart disease by age group. The
table also gives the age group midpoint (x) and


y
  
     
, where  denotes the
proportion in an age group with coronary heart disease.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item (i) (a) Calculate an estimate of the probability of having coronary heart
disease under the assumption that the probability does not differ over
the age groups.
\item (b) Construct an 8 	 2 contingency table with marginal totals and conduct
a 2
 test for differences in the probability of having coronary heart
disease for the different age groups. [8]
\item (ii) Consider the regression model y =  x .

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (a) Draw a scatterplot of y against x, and comment on the appropriateness
of the suggested model.
    \item (b) Calculate the least squares fitted regression line of y on x.
    \item (c) Calculate a 99\% confidence interval for the slope parameter.
    \item (d) Interpret the result obtained in (i)(b) with reference to the confidence
interval obtained in (ii)(c).

\item Strongly reject null hypothesis of constant probability over the
different age groups. [Note: If one decides to combine cells to
safeguard against very low expected frequencies, one should combine
adjacent cells.]

Linear model seems appropriate, but extremes (x = 25 and x = 65) are
not as good as 32.557.5 age range.

\item (d) In (i)(b), the probability of having coronary heart disease was found to vary with age. The 99\% confidence interval for the slope parameter in the regression obtained in (ii)(c) also shows that the probability of having coronary heart disease depends (linearly) on age as zero is not within the interval.
