\begin{document}  11 Consider a group of n males each aged 30 years living in a particular society. The
lives may be assumed to be independent.
Suppose that x of the n men die by the end of a subsequent period of duration t0 years
and that n  x survive the period.
Suppose that the lifetime of these men from age 30 is to be modelled as a random
variable with an exponential distribution with mean 1/ hours.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 
(i) State the distribution of the random variable X whose value x, the number of
men who die within t0 years, has been observed. 
\item (ii) (a) Verify that the log-likelihood of the observation x is given by:
\[  = log L( ) = x log(1 e t0 ) (n x) t0 
       + constant\]
(b) Determine , the maximum likelihood estimator of .
\item (iii) Show that

\item (iv) (a) Consider the case n = 1,000, t0 = 20 years, and x = 320.
Evaluate , and show that the value of its standard error is
approximately 0.00108.
\item (b) Hence, calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval for the mean
lifetime from age 30 of such men. [7]

\item There was a slight error in line 6 of Question 11: the last word should have appeared as
years instead of hours. The examiners took this into account, and gave full credit to
any candidates who provided an alternative answer because of this.
