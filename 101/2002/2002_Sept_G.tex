\item 10 The number of claims N which arise from a portfolio of business is modelled as a
Poisson variable with mean . The claim amounts Xi : i = 1, 2 , ..., N are modelled as
independent gamma variables each with parameters  and  and are independent of
N. Let S be the total claim amount arising from this portfolio.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item (i) Obtain expressions for the mean and standard deviation of S in terms of , 
and using general results for the mean and variance of S, 
\item (ii) Consider the case where  = 100 and the individual claim amounts have mean
£100 and standard deviation £50.
(a) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the total claim amount S.
\item (b) Calculate an approximate value for the probability that the total claim
amount S exceeds £12,500, giving a brief justification of your
approach.
