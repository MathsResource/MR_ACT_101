5 When comparing the mean premiums for policies issued by two companies, a twosample
t test is performed assuming equal population variances. The sample sizes and
sample variances are given by
2
n1 25 , s1 139.7
2
n2 30 , s2 76.6
Perform an appropriate F test at the 5% level to investigate the validity of the equal
variance assumption. [3]

6 A 2 2 contingency table was set up to investigate whether or not two classification
criteria are independent and resulted in the following data:
I II
A 22 28 50
B 28 22 50
50 50 100
Calculate the observed 2 test statistic and state an appropriate conclusion concerning
the independence of the two criteria.

form

(i) Verify that k = 0.0002. [1]
(ii) Determine the mean of this claim size distribution. [2]
(iii) Calculate the probability that an individual claim size is greater than 50. [1]
(iv) Calculate the probability that an individual claim size is less than 60 given that
it is greater than 50. [3]

8 Let X1, X2 , , X100 be independent random variables, each having a gamma(4,1)
distribution (and hence with mean 4 and variance 4).
Calculate an approximate value for the probability that the sum of the variables
assumes a value which exceeds 425. [3]

F24,29 critical value at 5% is 2.154 (two-sided test)
accept H0 : equal variances at the 5% level.
Examiners Comments: A test for equality of variances as asked for here is a twosided
test, but since we always use the observed ratio with the larger sample variance
on the numerator, we look at the upper tail of the reference F distribution. For a 5%
test we look at the upper 2.5% tail, not the upper 5% tail, as some candidates did.

there is no evidence to reject the independence of the two criteria.
Examiners Comments: Although not covered in the Core Reading, the use of Yates
correction in this situation (in which the 2 statistic has only 1 degree of freedom) is
acceptable. Using it gives 2 = 1, a P-value of 0.32, and the same conclusion.
