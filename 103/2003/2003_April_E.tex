Xt, is assumed to be independent of anything that has happened before time t and to
have distribution:

(iii) Assuming that p  q, calculate the probability that, starting from m, the share
price reaches 0 before it reaches N, i.e. P(ST = 0

which shows that Yn is a martingale.
By taking expectations, we obtain that E(Yn+1) = E(Yn), and this in turn implies
that E(Yn) = E(Y0) = (q/p)m.
(ii) (a) It is clear that T is a stopping time with respect to this martingale, since
the event that the share has reached 0 or N by time n depends only on
X1, X2, Â…, Xn and m.]
For n  T, we have 0  Sn  N,
Yn = (q / p)Sn  (q / p)N if q > p, or Yn  1 if q  p.
(b) The conditions of the optional stopping theorem are satisfied. It
follows that E(YT) = E(Y0) = (q/p)m.

But E(Xn+1) = 0, 2
E(Xn 1)  = p + q = 2p, and the last equation gives
E(Zn+1X1, X2, Â…, Xn) = Sn2  2np = Zn , so that {Zn} is a martingale.
(b) The conditions of the optional stopping theorem are not satisfied, since
2 2 Sn np  is not bounded below for 0  n  T. But we can work with a
truncated stopping time TK = min(T, K), for which the conditions of the
OST are satisfied, then let K  .
Applying the optional stopping theorem we get
E(ZT) = E(Z0) = m2.

But E(ZT) = E(ST2 ) 	2pE(T) = N2P(ST = N)  2p E(T) and we are
given that P(ST = N) = m/N. Thus m2 = E(ZT) = Nm  2pE(T), which
implies that E(T) = m(N  m)/(2p), as required.
Parts (i) and (iv)(a) were generally answered successfully.
Part (ii): in (a), the bounds on (q/p)Sn must be shown to apply for any p and q, not
just some; the main problem with (b) was that many did not mention the Optional
Stopping Theorem as justification for claiming that E(YT) = E(Y0).
Of the candidates who attempted (iv)(b), very few noticed that the stopping time did
not meet the requirements of the OST, so needs to be truncated.
