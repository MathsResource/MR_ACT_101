    \item (i) Let Yt denote Brownian motion with drift \mu and variance rate $\sigma^2$, starting at 0.
Write down the expectation $E(Y_t)$ and variance Var(Yt) of this process. [1]
\item (ii) Let Xt denote a biased random walk which moves up or down by D at time
intervals of size h, i.e.
Xt = 1

where Z1, Z2, Â… are independent random variables, each with distribution $P[Z_i = D] = p$, P[Zi = 	D] = 1 	 p. Calculate the expectation and variance of Xnh and derive an expression for the expectation and variance of $X_t$. 
[Notation: x denotes the integer part of x.]
\item (iii) (a) Use the approximation x  x to derive conditions on p and D such
that the expectation and variance of the process $X_t$ approximate for
large t those of a Brownian motion with drift $\mu$ and variance rate $\sigma^2$.
(b) Comment on the values of h for which such an approximation might be
appropriate.

This applies only when 0  |h| < 1. Small values of h should be used
because the random walk model converges to Brownian motion /
diffusion as h \mu 0.

%% Parts (i) and (ii) were well answered  maybe half the people successfully equated the random walk moments with the Brownian motion ones  although many candidates failed to see the derivation of the conditions on p and D through to completion. The biggest problem was the last part: "h small" is on the whole a bit too vague to get the full credit.
