the probability that it will break down in (t, t + dt) is independent of the state of the
other cash dispensers and is equal to
Î± dt + o(dt).
When a cash dispenser breaks down, repair work begins immediately. The time taken
to repair a broken machine is exponentially distributed with mean 1/Î². There are
enough repair teams to repair all three cash dispensers at the same time, if necessary.
Define Xt as the number of machines not working at time t.
(i) Write down the state space for Xt. [1]
(ii) (a) If a cash dispenser is working at time 0, prove that the time until its
first breakdown is exponentially distributed with mean 1/Î±.
(b) If all three cash dispensers are working at time 0, derive the
distribution of the time until the first breakdown. [5]
(iii) Define Pm(t) as the probability that m machines are not working at time t.
Show that the forward equations for the process X imply that:
P0(t) = 3P0 (t) P1(t)
P3(t) =  3P3(t)  P2 (t)

8 (i) State space for Xt is {0, 1, 2, 3}.
(ii) (a) Let T be the time taken for a cash dispenser to break down. From the
question:

Integrate this to get ln 1 F t  =  t  const
Since F(0) = 0, we can set const = 0, and hence F(t) = 1 Â– eÎ±t
That is, T has an exponential distribution with mean 1/Î±.
(b) P(no breakdowns by time t) = (et)3 = e3t. Thus the time until the
first breakdown is exponentially distributed with parameter 3.
(iii) P(X(t + h) = m) = P(X(t) = m, X(t + h) = m) + P(X(t) = m  1, X(t + h) = m)
+ P(X(t) = m + 1, X(t + h) = m) + o(h).

Almost everyone got part (i). In part (ii), stating the time until first breakdown is
exponential in (a) is not sufficient: it was necessary to derive this from first principles.
Similarly, a reasonable number got the answer to (b) without deriving it properly.
The most successful strategy for part (iii) was writing the generator matrix and
getting the equations from there.
Only the exceptional candidate attempted (iv); the algebra was tough, but did not
involve any tricks.
