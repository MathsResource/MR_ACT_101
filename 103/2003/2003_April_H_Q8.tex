8 A branch of a bank has three cash dispensers. If at time t a cash dispenser is working,
the probability that it will break down in (t, t + dt) is independent of the state of the
other cash dispensers and is equal to
\[\alpha dt + o(dt).\]
When a cash dispenser breaks down, repair work begins immediately. The time taken
to repair a broken machine is exponentially distributed with mean 1/\beta. There are
enough repair teams to repair all three cash dispensers at the same time, if necessary.
Define Xt as the number of machines not working at time t.
\begin{enumerate}
\item (i) Write down the state space for Xt. [1]
\item (ii) (a) If a cash dispenser is working at time 0, prove that the time until its
first breakdown is exponentially distributed with mean 1/Î±.
(b) If all three cash dispensers are working at time 0, derive the
distribution of the time until the first breakdown. [5]
\item (iii) Define Pm(t) as the probability that m machines are not working at time t.
Show that the forward equations for the process X imply that:
P0(t) = 3P0 (t) P1(t)
P3(t) =  3P3(t)  P2 (t)
and for m = 1, 2,
Pm(t) = ((3 m) m )Pm(t) (4 m) Pm 1(t) (m 1) Pm 1(t)              .
\item 
(iv) At time 0 all three cash dispensers are working. Show that the forward
equations have a solution

8 (i) State space for Xt is {0, 1, 2, 3}.
(ii) (a) Let T be the time taken for a cash dispenser to break down. From the

Integrate this to get ln 1 F t  =  t  const
\begin{itemize}
\item Since F(0) = 0, we can set const = 0, and hence F(t) = 1 Â– eÎ±t
That is, T has an exponential distribution with mean 1/Î±.
(b) P(no breakdowns by time t) = (et)3 = e3t. Thus the time until the
first breakdown is exponentially distributed with parameter 3.
\item (iii) P(X(t + h) = m) = P(X(t) = m, X(t + h) = m) + P(X(t) = m  1, X(t + h) = m)
+ P(X(t) = m + 1, X(t + h) = m) + o(h).

% Almost everyone got part (i). In part (ii), stating the time until first breakdown is exponential in (a) is not sufficient: it was necessary to derive this from first principles.
% Similarly, a reasonable number got the answer to (b) without deriving it properly.
% The most successful strategy for part (iii) was writing the generator matrix and getting the equations from there.
Only the exceptional candidate attempted (iv); the algebra was tough, but did not involve any tricks.
