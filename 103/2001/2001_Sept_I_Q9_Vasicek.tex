In the Vasicek model, the spot rate of interest is governed by the stochastic differential equation
\[dr t = a(b − r t ) dt + σdB t\]
where B t is a standard Brownian motion and a, b > 0.
(i)
A stochastic process {U t : t ≥ 0} is defined by U t = e at r t .
(a) Derive an equation for dU t .
(b) Solve the equation to find U t .
(c) Show that
r t = b + (r 0 − b) e − at + σ

(ii) State the probability distribution of r t and its limit for large t.
(iii) Derive, in the case s < t, the conditional expectation E[r t . s ], where {. s : s ≥ 0} is the filtration generated by the Brownian motion B.

dU t = d(e at r t ) = ae at r t dt + e at dr t

= e at [ar t dt + ab dt - ar t dt + sdB t ]
