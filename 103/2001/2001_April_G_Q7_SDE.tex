\begin{document}

The evolution of a stock price S t is modelled by
\[S_t = e \mu t +σ B t ,\]
where B t represents a standard Brownian motion, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are fixed parameters
and the initial value of the stock is S 0 = 1.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item (i) Derive an expression for $P{S t \leq x}$.% [2]
\item (ii) Derive expressions for the median of S t and the expectation of S t . [4]
\item (iii) (a) Determine an expression for the conditional expectation E(S t F s ),
where $s < t$ and where ${F s : s \geq 0}$ denotes the filtration associated
with the process S.
(b) Find conditions on \mu and σ under which the process {S t : t \geq 0} is a
martingale.
(c) State, with reasons, whether or not the stock would be a good long
term investment in this case.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item (i)
\begin{eqnarray*}
P{S t \leq x} &=& P{exp (\mut + \beta B t ) \leq x} \\ 
&=& P{\mut + \beta  tN \leq ln(x)} \\ 
&=& \Phi ( ln( x ) − \mu t \beta  t ) , \\
\end{eqnarray*}

, where
Φ denotes the standard Normal distribution function.
\item (ii)
We have to find m so that 
\begin{eqnarray*}
P{S t \leq m} &=& P { e \mu t +\beta  B t \leq m }\\
&=& P{\mut + \beta B t \leq ln (m)}\\
&=& P{\beta B t \leq ln (m) −\mut} \\
&=& \frac{1}{2}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

. Since \beta B t is a symmetric normal variable, its
median is 0 and the last equation can only be satisfied if ln(m) − \mut = 0
and m = e \mut .
The expectation is ES t = Ee (\mut+\beta B(t)) = Ee \mut e \beta

\item (iii)
By the same token, E(S t F s ) = S(s) E(e
\mu ( t−s )+ \beta  ( B ( t ) −B ( s ))
) = S(s)
( \mu+ ) ( t − s ) .

If S is to be a martingale, the conditional expectation must be equal to
S(s).
This will happen if \mu = − 12 \beta  2 .
From part (ii) we see that for this stock with initial value 1, the median of
the distribution at time t goes to 0 exponentially fast for large t hence, a
very bad investment!
