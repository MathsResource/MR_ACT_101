(i) Give a definition of the spectral density of a stationary time series, expressed in terms of the autocovariance function {γ k : k ∈ Z} of the
process. Use this definition to derive the spectral density of a first-order moving average process and of a first-order autoregression.
[5]
(ii) Suppose the “inverse” of a time series model with spectral density f(ω) is 1
. Using part (i), state
defined to be the model with spectral density
f ( ω )
the form of the inverse of a first-order moving average and state the way in which the inverse of an invertible MA(1) differs from the inverse of a non-invertible MA(1).

Let X n denote an autoregressive high frequency time series modelled by:
X n+1 = (1 − \alpha) X n + θ + τe n ,
where e n = ±1 with equal probabilities and \alpha, θ, τ are constant parameters. An analyst wishes to investigate whether this series may be approximated by some continuous time diffusion, i.e. X n ≈ Y nh , where Y t satisfies a stochastic differential
equation
\[dY t = \mu(Y t ) dt + dB t\]
and B t denotes standard Brownian motion.
