2 Yt, t = 1, 2, ., is a time series defined by
Yt Yt 1 Zt 1  Zt 1  
   
where Zt, t = 0, 1, , is a sequence of independent zero-mean variables with
common variance 2 and where || < 1.
(i) State, giving your reasons, the values of p, d and q for which Y is an
ARIMA(p, d, q) process. [2]
(ii) Derive the autocorrelation function 	k, k = 0, 1, 2, . [6]

2 (i) Since the equation can be written (1  B) Y = (1 + (1  )B)Z, the process is
ARMA(1,1), or ARIMA(1,0,1).
(ii) There are a number of possible ways to calculate the k, and one way which
sidesteps the k and calculates the k directly. The solution presented here is
one of the possible answers; other methods were marked on their merits.
k = CovYt ,Yt k    .
Rearrange the time series equation to give Yt = Yt 1 Zt 1  Zt 1      
Now Cov[Yt, Zt] = σ2

and Cov[Yt, Zt1] = α.Cov[Yt1, Zt1] + Cov[Zt, Zt1] + (1  α).Cov[Zt1, Zt1]
= α.σ2 + 0 + (1  α).σ2 = σ2

Part (i) was generally well answered, using a variety of different approaches. Candidates
generally made good attempts at part (ii), the main problems occurring being a failure to
correctly specify γ0 and algebraic errors in solving the simultaneous equations.
