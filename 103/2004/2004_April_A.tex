1 The stochastic differential equation for geometric Brownian motion is given by
dXt = Xt dt + Xt dBt
where Bt is a standard Brownian motion. Show that the solution to the differential
equation which also satisfies
t0 X x is
0
1 2
2 0 Xt x exp Bt Bt t t
for t t0. [4]

1 First method (direct method):
Let f(Xt) = ln Xt . Using It√¥ s Lemma we have
df = 1 2 2
2 f Xtdt XtdBt f ( Xt )dt
= 1 2 2

= 1 2

Integrating from t0 to t we have
0 0

2 0 ln Xt ln Xt t t Bt Bt
and using the initial condition we get

2 0 Xt x exp Bt Bt t t as required.
Alternative method (working backwards from the solution)
Let

2 0 f (t, Bt ) x exp Bt Bt t t . Then

2 2 1 1
2 2 t t t t t t t t df f dt f dB f dt f dt f dB
This implies that Xt = f(t,Bt) satisfies the stochastic differential equation.
We need to verify that the initial condition holds for this solution. (It clearly does, but
the check needs to be performed.)
Considering that this stochastic differential equation is the most frequently used of all,
this question was on average very poorly answered.
