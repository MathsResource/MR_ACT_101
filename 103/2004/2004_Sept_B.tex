END OF PAPER
4 (i) A standard Brownian motion {Bt} is defined by the following properties:
B(0) 0 and Bt has independent increments; Bt Bs is independent of
Bu for 0 u s and s t .
Bt has stationary and Gaussian increments; Bt Bs N(0 t s) .
Bt has continuous sample paths, i.e. t Bt is continuous.

Substituting the values x 120 y 96 0 2 0 15 and t 0 25 years
above we find that the answer is

The calculations in parts (ii) and (iii) were well done. The definition in part
(i) caused some problems: it is necessary to mention the stationary,
independent increments property; then either of the two remaining properties
(continuous sample paths, normally distributed increments) implies the other.
5 (i) The Markov property is clear: the chain jumps either up or down by 1, with
probabilities depending only on the current state, not the past history.
P(Xn 1 i 1| Xn i) is the probability that the (n+1)th ball selected is red,
which is just 1/N of the number of red balls at time n, which is N i.
(ii) From any state i it is possible to reach any other state j in just |j i| steps,
either all upwards or all downwards. This means that the chain is irreducible.
Every transition takes the chain from an even state to an odd one or vice versa,
which implies that the period must be an even number.
On the other hand, starting from state 0 it is possible to return to 0 in two
steps. Therefore state 0 has period 2 and, by irreducibility, all states have
period 2.
(iii) To find the stationary distribution we can use the relationship suggested by the
Detailed Balance Equations:
1

i i
N i i
N N
for i = 0, 1, 2, ., N 1.
Thus we get the recursive relationship

for i = 0, 1, 2, ., N 1

(iv) P(Xn j | X0 0) does not converge, being alternately zero and non-zero,
since X is periodic.
The derivation of the stationary distribution in part (iii) caused difficulties
with many candidates, but otherwise candidates showed a good understanding
of discrete-time Markov chains.
