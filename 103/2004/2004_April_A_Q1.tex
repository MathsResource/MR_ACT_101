2 A Box-Jenkins model-fitting procedure suggests that the best fitting model for a set of
normalised share price data x1, , xn is ARMA(1,2), with equation
Xt 0.63Xt 1 et 0.45et 1 0.34et 2 ,
where {e1, e2, } is a sequence of uncorrelated, zero-mean random variables with
variance 2.
(i) Determine whether the model is stationary and invertible. [2]
(ii) Calculate 0, 1, 2, the autocovariance function of the fitted model at lags 0, 1,
and 2, in terms of 2. [4]
[Total 6]

2 (i) The solution to 1 0.63z 0 is z = 1/0.63, which is greater than 1. Therefore
the model is stationary.
For invertibility, we should check that the roots of 1 0.45z 0.34z2 0 are
outside the unit circle. They are ( 0.45 1.25)/( 2*0.34) = 2.5 or 1.18, both
OK.

(ii) Let 0 = Cov(Xt, et), 1 = Cov(Xt, et 1), 2 = Cov(Xt, et 2). Then
0 = 0.63 1 + 0 + 0.45 1 0.34 2
1 = 0.63 0 + 0.45 0 0.34 1
2 = 0.63 1 0.34 0
0 = 2 (this may be regarded as obvious and not stated explicitly)
1 = 0.63 0 + 0.45 2 = 1.08 2
2 = 0.63 1 0.34 2 = 0.3404 2
An alternative expression for 0 may be obtained using
0 1 1 2
2 2 2 2
0 0 1
Var(0.63 0.45 0.34 )
0.63 (1 0.45 0.34 ) 2 0.63[0.45 0.34 ]
t t t t X e e e
which removes the need to calculate 2.
Having derived the equations, we need to solve them.
1 = 0.63 0 + 0.0828 2
0 = 0.63(0.63 0 + 0.0828 2) + 1.370 2 = 0.3969 0 + 1.422 2,
implying that
0 = 2.358 2, 1 = 1.5684 2, 2 = 0.6481 2.
Candidates were often unsure of the procedure required to derive the equations for the k but
did rather better at solving them. In particular, many candidates did not take correct
account of the relationship between Xt and past values of et. Marks were awarded for correct
methodology when deriving the solutions, even if the equations being solved were not the
right ones.
