The total number of claims received by an insurance company is described by
an inhomogeneous Poisson process with rate λ(t).
Write down the Kolmogorov forward equations for this process and show that,
as in the homogeneous case, the solution is of the form
P 0j (s, t) =
where m(s, t) =

( m ( s , t )) j e − m ( s , t )

According to a model used in econometrics, three economic time series, X, Y
and Z, are related to one another by the equations
X n = X n−1 + θ X Z n−1 + e 1,n
Y n = Y n−1 + θ Y Z n−1 + e 2,n
Z n =
θ Z Z n−1 + e 3,n
where each of θ X , θ Y and θ Z lies in the interval (−1, +1) and the random
variables {e i,n : n ≥ 1, i = 1, 2, 3} may be assumed to be uncorrelated and to have
mean zero.
State, giving your reasons:
(a) whether X, Y and Z are I(0) or I(1)
(b) whether each of X, Y and Z individually satisfies the Markov property
(c) whether the vector-valued process {(X n , Y n , Z n ) : n ≥ 1} satisfies the
Markov property
(d) whether X and Y are cointegrated
