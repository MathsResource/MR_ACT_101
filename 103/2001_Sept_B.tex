A stationary stochastic process {Y t : t = 0, 1, ...} satisfies the relationship
Y t = \mu + 0.8(Y t−1 − \mu) − 0.4(Y t−2 − \mu) + e t ,
where {e t : t = 0, 1, ...} is a sequence of independent, zero-mean Normal random
variables with common variance σ 2 .

(i) Calculate the autocorrelation function, ρ k , and the partial autocorrelation
function, φ k , of Y for k = 1 and 2.

(ii) State, without performing additional calculations, what you would expect

to find if you were to calculate ρ k and φ k for larger values of k.

Consider the simplified model of credit rating of companies in continuous time
described below. There are three ratings which a company can have, A, B and D
(default) and the possible transitions are as follows:
•
•
•
(i)
from A to B with rate 4\alpha
from B to A with rate \alpha
from B to D with rate 3\alpha
Write down the matrix form of Kolmogorov’s forward equations as it
applies to this model and verify that the transition matrix P(t) = P(0, t)
given below is a solution:
