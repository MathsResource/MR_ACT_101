8 Consider two independent lives A and B. The probabilities that A and B die
within a specified period are 0.1 and 0.2 respectively. If A dies you lose £50,000,
whether or not B dies. If B dies you lose £30,000, whether or not A dies.
(i) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of your total losses in the
period. [4]
(ii) Calculate your expected loss within the period, given that one, and only
one, of A and B dies.

9 The movement of a stock price is modelled as follows:
In each time period, the stock either goes up 1 with probability 0.35 , stays the
same with probability 0.35, or goes down 1 with probability 0.30.
The change in the stock price after 500 time periods is being considered.
(i) Assuming that changes in successive time periods are independent,
explain why the normal distribution can be used as an approximate
model. [1]
(ii) Calculate an approximate value for the probability that, after 500 time
periods, the stock will be up by more than 20 from where it started. [4]

10 Claim amounts of a certain type are modelled using a normal distribution with
an unknown mean and a known standard deviation σ = £20.
For a random sample of 20 claim amounts all that is known is that 5 of them are
greater than £200.
(i) Let θ be the probability that a claim amount is greater than £200. Write
down the maximum likelihood estimate of θ. [1]
(ii) Determine θ in terms of μ and hence calculate the maximum likelihood
estimate of μ.

11 Previous years records give that the standard deviation of claim size for a certain
class of policy is £75. The distribution of claim size is to be modelled as a normal
random variable.
(i) Determine the minimum sample size required to estimate the mean claim
size such that a 95% confidence interval is of width ±£10. [2]
(ii) Calculate the corresponding sample size such that a 99% confidence
interval is of width ±£10. [2]

12 In 1998 a market research organisation conducted a survey in a large city. A
random sample of 400 households showed that 68 were such that at least one
person in the household was a member of a health/fitness club.
(i) An estimate of the true proportion of households in the city with at least
one person being a member of a health/fitness club is therefore
68
400
= 0.17. Calculate 95% confidence limits for the true proportion.
[2]
(ii) A similar survey was conducted in 1999 and a random sample of 400
households showed that 80 were such that at least one person in the
household was a member of a health/fitness club.
Perform a one-sided test to investigate whether the true proportion
increased from 1998 to 1999. In particular determine the p-value of the
test and state your conclusion.

8 (i) Let XA = 1 if A dies and 0 if not. Similarly XB for life B.
E(XA) = 0.1, V(XA) = 0.1 × 0.9 = 0.09;
E(XB) = 0.2, V(XB) = 0.2 × 0.8 = 0.16
Total losses T = 5XA + 3XB (units of £10,000)
so E(T) = (5 × 0.1) + (3 × 0.2) = 1.1 i.e. £11,000
and V(T) = (25 × 0.09) + (9 × 0.16) = 3.69 so SD(T) = 1.921
i.e. £19,210
[OR: T takes values 0, 3, 5, and 8 with probabilities 0.9 × 0.8 = 0.72, 0.2 ×
0.9 = 0.18, 0.1 × 0.8 = 0.08, and 0.1 × 0.2 = 0.02 respectively; hence find
E(T), E(T2), and V(T).]

(ii) P(exactly one of A, B dies) = 0.18 + 0.08 = 0.26
P(A dies|exactly one dies) = P(A dies and B does not die) / P(exactly one dies)
= 0.08/0.26 = 4/13 ; so P(B dies|exactly one dies) = 9/13
So E(loss|exactly one dies) = 5(4/13) + 3(9/13) = 47/13 = 3.615
i.e. £36,150

9 (i) The change after a large number of time periods equals the sum of i.i.d.
r.v.s.
The Central Limit theorem leads to an approximate normal distribution.
(ii)
x : +1 0 −1
p : 0.35 0.35 0.30
E(X) = 0.35 − 0.30 = 0.05
E(X2) = 0.35 + 0.30 = 0.65
∴Var(X) = 0.65 − (0.05)2 = 0.6475 ∴s.d.(X) = 0.8047
Let Y = price change after 500 periods
∴Y has mean 500(0.05) = 25 and s.d. 500(0.8047) =17.99
P(Y > 20)
