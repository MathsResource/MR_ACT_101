Using the invariance property of MLE’s, we get μ from the equation

So with θ = 0.25, we get μ from

∴ − μ from tables
∴μ = 200 − 20(0.674) = £186.52

There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is an increase in the
true proportion. The observed difference could have occurred by chance.
