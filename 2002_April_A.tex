\item 1 Let t px denote the probability that a life aged x survives for at least a further t years,
and consider three independent lives aged 40, 50 and 60 years such that
10 p40 = 0.95, 10 p50 = 0.85, 10 p60 = 0.70.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Determine the probability that exactly one of these three lives survives ten
years. 
\item Determine the probability that it is the youngest life that survives, given that
exactly one life survives ten years. [1]
\end{enumerate}
\item 2 Claim amounts are modelled as an exponential random variable with mean £1,000.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Calculate the probability that one such claim amount is greater than £5,000.
[1]
\item Calculate the probability that a claim amount is greater than £5,000 given that
it is greater than £1,000. 
\end{enumerate}
\item  A magazine claims that 25% of its readers are students. A random sample of 200
readers is taken and is found to contain 42 students.
Calculate the probability of obtaining 42 or fewer student readers, assuming that the magazines claim is correct. [3]
\item  The percentage return on an investment of a particular type over a period of one year is to be modelled as a normal random variable X with mean  and variance 1. A
potential investor is interested in the chance that the return on such an investment will
exceed 9%.
A random sample of ten such returns have values
7.3, 8.9, 8.3, 6.2, 9.8, 7.7, 9.4 , 7.9, 9.1, and 7.4 .
Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of  = P(X > 9). [3]

3 Let X denote the number of magazine readers in the sample of 200 who are students.
Assuming the magazines claim is correct, X ~ binomial (200, 0.25).
Using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution,
X ~ N(50, 150/4) approximately:
P(X  42)  42.5 50

where Z ~ N(0, 1)
