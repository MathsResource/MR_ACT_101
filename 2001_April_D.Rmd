\begin{enumerate}
\item A random sample of insurance policies on the contents of private houses written
by each of three companies was examined and the sum insured (y) under each
policy noted. The results are summarised below (in units of £100).

For all 37 observations: Σy = 4302 , Σy2 = 521662 .
Consider the model
= , =1,2,3 Yij μ + τi + eij i ; j =1,2,...,ni

where Yij is the jth sum insured for company i, ni is the number of responses
available for company i, the ij e are independent normal variables, each with zero
mean and variance σ2, and 0 i i
% i
% n τ = .

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) Calculate the values of the least squares/maximum likelihood estimates of
μ and τi , i = 1, 2, 3. 
\item Perform an analysis of variance to investigate whether real differences
exist among the means of the sums insured under such policies issued by
the three companies. [5]
\end{enumerate}
\item 
14 Consider a group of 1000 policyholders, all of the same age, and each of whose
lives is insured under one or more policies. The following frequency distribution
gives the number of claims per policyholder in 1999 for this group.
Number of claims per policyholder (i) 0 1 2 3 ≥4
Number of policyholders (fi ) 826 128 39 7 0
A statistician argues that an appropriate model for the distribution of X, the
number of claims per policyholder, is X ~ Poisson. Under this proposal, the
frequencies expected are as follows (you are not required to verify these):
Number of claims per policyholder 0 1 2 3 ≥4
Expected number of policyholders 796.9 180.9 20.5 1.6 0.1
A second statistician argues that a more appropriate model for the distribution of
X is given by:
\[P(X = x) = p(1 − p)x , x = 0, 1, 2,\ldots\]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) Without doing any further calculations, comment on the first statisticians
proposed model for the data. [2]
Consider the second statistician's proposed model.
\item (ii) Verify that the mean of the distribution of X is (1  p)/p and hence
calculate the method of moments estimate of p. [4]
(Note: this estimate is also the maximum likelihood estimate.)
\item (iii) Verify that the frequencies expected under the second statistician's
proposed model are as follows:
Number of claims per policyholder 0 1 2 3 ≥4
Expected number of policyholders 815.0 150.8 27.9 5.2 1.2

\item (iv) (a) Test the goodness-of-fit of the second statisticians proposed model
to the data, quoting the p-value of your test statistic and your
conclusion.
(b) Assuming that you had been asked to test the goodness-of-fit at
the 1\% level, state your conclusion.

15 It has been decided to model a claim amount distribution using a gamma
distribution with parameters α = 4 and λ (unknown), that is, with density
f(x; λ) =
1

λ4 x3 e−λx: 0 < x < ∞.
(i) A random sample of n claim amounts, X1, X2,, Xn, is selected and it is
required to estimate the parameter λ.
(a) (1) Determine the method of moments estimator of λ.
(2) Show that the maximum likelihood estimator of λ is the
same as the method of moments estimator.
(b) (1) Write down the moment generating function of Xi and
derive the moment generating function of Y = 2nλX , where
X is the sample mean. Explain why the distribution of Y
is 28
χ n .
(2) Using Y = 2nλX as a pivotal quantity, derive a 95%
confidence interval for λ. [12]
(ii) A random sample of 10 claim amounts yields a sample mean of x = £242
and a standard deviation of s = £112.
(a) Using part (i), calculate a 95% confidence interval for λ.
(b) (1) Use the Central Limit theorem to obtain an approximate
95% confidence interval for the population mean.
(2) Calculate this confidence interval and convert it into an
approximate confidence interval for λ.
(3) Comment briefly on the comparison of this interval with
that obtained in part (ii)(a). [6]

\item  The table below gives data on the lean body mass (the weight without fat) and
resting metabolic rate for twelve women who were the subjects in a study of
obesity. The researchers suspected that metabolic rate is related to lean body
mass.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) Draw a scatter plot of the resting metabolic rate against lean body mass and comment briefly on any relationship.
   \item (ii) Calculate the least squares fit regression line in which resting metabolic rate is modelled as the response and the lean body mass as the explanatory variable. 
   \item (iii) Determine a 95\% confidence interval for the slope coefficient of the model.
State any assumptions made. 
   \item (iv) Use the fitted model to construct 95\% confidence intervals for the mean resting metabolic rate when:
(a) the lean body mass is 50kg
(b) the lean body mass is 75kg 
   \item (v) Comment on the appropriateness of each of the confidence intervals given
in (iv).

13 (i) Estimate of μ = 4302/37 = 116.27
Estimate of τ1 = 115.13 − 116.27 = −1.14;
estimate of τ2 = 95.00 − 116.27 = −21.27;
estimate of τ3 = 135.42 − 116.27 = 19.15
(ii) Total SS = 521662 − 43022/37 = 21467.3
Model (Explained) SS = 15(115.132) + 10(952) + 12(135.422) − 43022/37
= 8942.0 **
∴Error SS = 21467.3 − 8942.0 = 12525.3 **
F = (8942.0/2)/(12525.3/34) = 12.1 on 2,34 degrees of freedom
Upper 1% point for F2,34 ≈ 5.3 so here P-value << 0.01
Overwhelming evidence against hypothesis H0 : τi = 0 , i = 1,2,3.
We conclude that real differences do exist : there is a company effect.
[** OR: Error SS = (14 × 196.41) + (9 × 341.33) + (11 × 609.36) = 12524.7
∴ Model SS = 21467.3 − 12524.7 = 8942.6]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
14 (i) The model greatly overestimates the number of policyholders who give
rise to exactly one claim, and greatly underestimates the number who give
rise to multiple claims.
(ii) E(X) = 1 × p(1−p) + 2 × p(1−p)2 + 3 × p(1−p)3 + 
= p(1−p)[1 + 2(1−p) + 3(1−p)2 + ] = p(1−p)[1  (1−p)]−2 = (1−p)/p
Data mean is (128 + 78 + 21)/1000 = 0.227
so the method of moments estimate * of p is given by solving
(1−p)/p = 0.227, which gives estimate of p = 0.81500.
* it is also in fact the MLE
(iii) Estimates of probabilities for 0,1,2, and 3 claims are then 0.815,
0.815 × 0.185 = 0.15078, 0.815 × 0.1852 = 0.02789, and
0.815 × 0.1853 = 0.00516
So, for 4 or more claims, estimate is 1  0.99883 = 0.00117.
Hence expected frequencies are as follows:
Number of claims per policyholder  0 1 2 3 ≥4
Expected number of policyholders 815.0 150.8 27.9 5.2 1.2
(iv) (a) Using 5 cells:
χ2 = (826815)2/815+(128150.8)2/150.8+(3927.9)2/27.9 +(75.2)2/5.2
+ 1.22/1.2 = 9.84 on 3 df
P-value is between 0.025 and 0.01
There is quite strong evidence against the null hypothesis (that the
second statisticians model describes the data) and we conclude that
the model does not provide a good fit to the data.
[Alternative solution: Using 4 cells (for 0 , 1 , 2 , and ≥ 3) the χ2 value
is 8.07 on 2df. P-value is again between 0.025 and 0.01.]
  (b) The P-value exceeds 0.01 so we cannot reject the hypothesis.
The hypothesis that the model describes the data stands.
