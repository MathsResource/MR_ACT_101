A random sample of 16 observations was selected from each of four populations.
Given that the between treatments mean square is 280 and the total sum of squares is
SS T = 1,500, construct an analysis of variance table and test the null hypothesis that
the means of the four populations are equal.

A sample of 20 claim amounts (£) on a group of household policies gave the
following data summaries:
x = 3,256 and
8
x 2 = 866,600.
(a) Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation for these claim amounts.
(b) Comment on the skewness of the distribution of these claim amounts, giving
reasons for your answer.

A simple procedure for incorporating a no claims discount into an annual insurance
policy is as follows:
a premium of £400 is payable for the first year;
if no claim is made in the first year, the premium for the second year is £400k,
where k is a constant such that 0 < k < 1;
if no claim is made in the first and second years, the premium for the third
year is £400k 2 ;
if no subsequent claims are made in future years, the premium remains as
£400k 2 ;
if a claim is made, the premium the following year reverts to £400 and the
procedure starts again as above.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%5

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Show that the probability distribution of the premium for the fourth year, that
is, for the year following the third year, is given by
£400
with probability
£400k with probability
£400k 2 with probability
p
p(1 p)
(1 p) 2
where p is the probability of a claim being made in any year.

\item  Obtain an expression for the expected premium for the fourth year under this
procedure.

\item If it is desired that this expected premium should equal £300, determine the
required value of k for the case where p = 0.1.
\end{enumerate}

Random samples are taken from two independent normally distributed populations
(with means 1 and 2 respectively) with the following results.
Sample from population 1:
sample size n 1 = 11, sample mean x 1 124 , sample variance s 1 2
59
Sample from population 2:
sample size n 2 = 15, sample mean x 2 105 , sample variance s 2 2
42
Calculate a 95% confidence interval for 1
2 , the difference between the
population means (you may assume that the population variances are equal).

F = 280/11 which equals 25.45.
Therefore there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the four population
means are not equal (F 3,60 (5%) = 2.758, F 3,60 (1%) = 4.126).

(b) Distribution must have strong positive skewness
since the s.d. is large relative to the mean and the amounts must be positive.
(i) Using C for a claim, N for no claim, then
P(premium = 400) = P(C in year 3, regardless of the first 2 years) = p
P(premium = 400k) = P(CN in years 2/3, regardless of the first year) = p(1 p)
P(premium = 400k 2 ) = P(NN in years 2/3, regardless of the first year) = (1 p) 2
[These probabilities may be derived in other ways, such as via a tree diagram]
