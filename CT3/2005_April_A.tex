Claim sizes in a certain insurance situation are modelled by a distribution with
moment generating function M(t) given by
M(t) = (1 10t) 2 .
Show that E[X 2 ] = 600 and find the value of E[X 3 ].

Consider a random sample of size 16 taken from a normal distribution with mean
= 25 and variance 2 = 4. Let the sample mean be denoted X .
State the distribution of X and hence calculate the probability that X assumes a
value greater than 26.
