In an experiment to compare the effects of vaccines of differing strengths intended to
give protection to children against a particular condition, twelve batches of vaccine
were tested in twelve equal-sized groups of children. The percentages of children
who subsequently remained healthy after exposure to the condition, named the PRH
values, were recorded. The strength of each batch of vaccine was measured by an
independent test and recorded as the SV value.

It is evident that one of the observations is out of line and so may have an undue
effect on any regression analysis. You are asked to investigate this as follows.
(ii)
(a) Calculate the total, regression, and error sums of squares for a least-
squares linear regression analysis for predicting PRH values from SV
values using all 12 data observations.
(b) Determine the coefficient of determination R 2 .
(c) Determine the equation of the fitted regression line.
(d) Examine whether or not there is evidence, at the 5% level of testing, to
enable one to conclude that the slope of the underlying regression
equation is non-zero.

Large change in slope (and intercept) of fitted line.
The total and error sums of squares are much reduced.
The fit of the linear regression model is much improved (R 2 is much
increased from 25.1% to 94.9%).
We have overwhelming evidence to justify concluding that the slope is
non-zero.
