(a) Calculate the sample mean number of thunderstorms.
(b) Calculate the sample median number of thunderstorms.
(c) Comment briefly on the comparison of the mean and the median.
\item 
2 In an opinion poll, each individual in a random sample of 275 individuals from a large
population is asked which political party he/she supports. If 45% of the population
support party A, calculate (approximately) the probability that at least 116 of the
sample support A.
\item 
3 Claim amounts on a certain type of policy are modelled as following a gamma
distribution with parameters = 120 and = 1.2.
Calculate an approximate value for the probability that an individual claim amount
exceeds 120, giving a reason for the approach you use.
\item 
4 Calculate a 99% confidence interval for the percentage of claims for household
accidental damage which are fully settled within six months of being submitted, given
that in a random sample of 100 submitted claims of this type, exactly 83 were fully
settled within six months of being submitted.
\item 
5 A random sample of 500 claim amounts resulted in a mean of £237 and a standard
deviation of £137.
Calculate an approximate 95% confidence interval for the true underlying mean claim
amount for such claims, explaining why the normal distribution can be used.

(a) x
(b) Median is (101/2) th observation i.e. the mean of the 50 th and 51 st observations
so median = 1
(c) Mean is higher than the median as the data are positively skewed (skewed to
the right).
Let X denote the number in the sample who support party A.
X ~ Binomial(275, 0.45)
E[X] = 275 0.45 = 123.75
V[X] = 275 0.45 0.55 = 68.0625
