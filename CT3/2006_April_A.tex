The stem and leaf plot below gives the surrender values (to the nearest 1,000) of 40
endowment policies issued in France and recently purchased by a dealer in such
policies in Paris. The stem unit is 10,000 and the leaf unit is 1,000.

In a certain large population 45% of people have blood group A. A random sample of
300 individuals is chosen from this population.
Calculate an approximate value for the probability that more than 115 of the sample
have blood group A.

A random sample of size 10 is taken from a normal distribution with mean
variance 2 = 1.

Find the probability that the sample variance exceeds 1, that is find P(S 2 > 1).

1 n = 40, so the median is the 20.5 th observation, which is 1⁄2(7.7+7.8) = 7.75.
This represents 77,500.
2 If X is the number in the sample with group A, then X has a binomial (300, 0.45)
distribution, so
E[X] = 300
0.45 = 135 and Var[X] = 300
0.45
0.55 = 74.25.
Then, using the continuity correction,

Let X = number of policies with claims
So X ~ binomial(25, p).
Poisson approximation is X Poisson(25p).
(a) using Poisson(2.5)
P(X 4) = 0.89118 from tables [or evaluation]
(b) using Poisson(5)
P(X 4) = 0.44049 again from tables
(2.26) = 0.99.Subject CT3 (Probability and Mathematical Statistics Core Technical)
(ii)

in (a) error is 0.8912 0.9020 = 0.0108
in (b) error is 0.4405 0.4207 = 0.0198
The approximation is valid for small p , and, as p is smaller in (a), this gives
a better approximation as noted with the smaller error.
[Note: candidates may also comment on the fact that the sample size 25 is not
large and so we would not expect the Poisson approximations to be very
good anyway. In fact the key to the approximations is the small p and here the
given approximations are quite good]
