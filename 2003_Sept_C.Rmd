\item
9 Suppose that the joint probability distribution of two random variables X and Y is
given by the following table:
Y
2 4 6
1 0.2 0.0 0.2
X 2 0.0 0.2 0.0
3 0.2 0.0 0.2
(i) Show that X and Y are uncorrelated, but are not independent. 
(ii) Leaving the probabilities in the first and third rows of the table the same,
change the entries in the second row so that X and Y are independent.

\item  The number of claims on a portfolio of policies was observed as follows:
Number of claims per day 0 1 2 3 4 5 Total
Frequency 48 32 17 2 0 1 100
Use a 2 goodness-of-fit test to test the hypothesis that the number of claims each day
follows a Poisson distribution. [7]
\item  The following table contains 10 claim amounts for repair costs arising from a
particular type of storm damage to private houses, for each of four different postcode
regions:
Regions

(i) Show that a one-way analysis of variance to compare the mean claim amounts
for the regions produces a significant result at the 5% level, but not at the 1%
level. 
(ii) Compare the mean claim amounts for the regions A, B, C, and D by using a
least significant difference approach with a significance level of 5%. 
\item  Let X denote the number of accidents a manual worker in a particular factory has in a
year. For a given worker the distribution of X is modelled as a Poisson distribution
with unknown parameter u that varies across the workforce. U is regarded as a
random variable which has a gamma distribution with parameters  and , i.e.
X | (U = u) 	 Poisson(u),
U 	 gamma(, ).

E[X] = 0.4 × 1 + 0.2 × 2 + 0.4 × 3 = 2
E[Y] = 0.4 × 2 + 0.2 × 4 + 0.4 × 6 = 4
E[XY] = 1 × 2 × 0.2 + 1 × 4 × 0.0 + 1 × 6 × 0.2

+ 3 × 2 × 0.2 + 3 × 4 × 0.0 + 3 × 6 × 0.2 = 8
E[XY] − E[X]E[Y] = 0 Therefore uncorrelated.
X and Y are not independent since
P(X = x and Y = y) ≠ P(X = x) P(Y = y)
e.g. x = 1 y = 2, 0.2 ≠ 0.4 × 0.4 = 0.16.
(ii) X and Y are independent if joint probability is:
Y
2 4 6
1 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4
X 2 0.1 0.0 0.1 0.2
3 0.2 0.0 0.2 0.4
0.5 0.0 0.5
10 The mean number of claims per day is
{(32 × 1) + (17 × 2) + (2 × 3) + (0 × 4) + (1 × 5)}/100 = 0.77.
Use 0.77 as an estimate of the mean of the Poisson distribution. Thus

The expected frequency for ≥ 3 is 3.5 + 0.7 + 0.1 = 4.3; the corresponding observed

There is insufficient evidence to suggest that the number of claims does not follow a
Poisson distribution (i.e. the model provides a good fit to the data).
An alternative solution (in this over-conservative approach some information is
thrown away unnecessarily - but it was awarded full marks):
Grouping categories x = 2, 3, 4 and ≥ 5 and using only 3 cells with observed
frequencies 48, 32, and 20 and expected frequencies 46.3, 35.7, and 18.0 gives χ2 =
0.668 on 1 degree of freedom. The probability value is 0.414. Same conclusion.

F = 79953/26925 = 2.97 on 3, 36 d.f.
Therefore, since the value of F3,36 (0.05) is 2.866, the observed F value (2.97)
exceeds it and so the null hypothesis that the population means are equal is
rejected at the 5% level of significance. However, as F3,36 (0.01) is 4.377, the
null hypothesis is not rejected at the 1% level.
(ii) Means:
A: y1. = 1304.6 B: y2. = 1259.2
C: y3. = 1096.5 D: y4. = 1212.8
Least significant difference, for each pair of regions, is (5% level):
1/2
t0.025,36 σˆ ( 1/10 +1/10) = 2.028 26925 (2/10)1/2 = 149
Differences between pairs of means:
y1. − y2. = 45.4 , y1. − y3. = 208.1 , y1. − y4. = 91.8
y2. − y3. =162.7 , y2. − y4. = 46.4 , y3. − y4. = −116.3
Region C Region D Region B Region A
y3. y4. y2. y1.
(Alternative answers which have the following conclusion are acceptable:
The population mean claim amount for region C appears to be less than the
population mean of region A and the population mean of region B. However,
the population mean for region C and the population mean for region D do not
appear to differ.)
