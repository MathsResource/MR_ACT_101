\item 5 Show that the probability generating function for a binomial (n, p) distribution is
GX (t) = (1 − p + pt)n .
Deduce the moment generating function. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 6 Let X have a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ, and let
the ith cumulant of the distribution of X be denoted κi .
Assuming the moment generating function of X, determine the values of κ2 , κ3 ,
and κ4 . 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 7 The number of policies (N) in a portfolio at any one time is modelled as a Poisson
random variable with mean 10.
The number of claims (Xi) arising on a policy is also modelled as a Poisson
random variable with mean 2, independently for each policy and independent
of N.
Determine the moment generating function for the total number of claims,

\item Consider two independent lives A and B. The probabilities that A and B die
within a specified period are 0.1 and 0.2 respectively. If A dies you lose £50,000,
whether or not B dies. If B dies you lose £30,000, whether or not A dies.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item (i) Calculate the mean and standard deviation of your total losses in the
period.
\item Calculate your expected loss within the period, given that one, and only
one, of A and B dies.

= μt + σ2t2/2
κr is the coefficient of tr/r! , r = 2,3,
∴ κ2 = σ2, κ3 = κ4 = 0

8 (i) Let XA = 1 if A dies and 0 if not. Similarly XB for life B.
E(XA) = 0.1, V(XA) = 0.1 × 0.9 = 0.09;
E(XB) = 0.2, V(XB) = 0.2 × 0.8 = 0.16
Total losses T = 5XA + 3XB (units of £10,000)
so E(T) = (5 × 0.1) + (3 × 0.2) = 1.1 i.e. £11,000
and V(T) = (25 × 0.09) + (9 × 0.16) = 3.69 so SD(T) = 1.921
i.e. £19,210
[OR: T takes values 0, 3, 5, and 8 with probabilities 0.9 × 0.8 = 0.72, 0.2 ×
0.9 = 0.18, 0.1 × 0.8 = 0.08, and 0.1 × 0.2 = 0.02 respectively; hence find
E(T), E(T2), and V(T).]

(ii) P(exactly one of A, B dies) = 0.18 + 0.08 = 0.26
P(A dies|exactly one dies) = P(A dies and B does not die) / P(exactly one dies)
= 0.08/0.26 = 4/13 ; so P(B dies|exactly one dies) = 9/13
So E(loss|exactly one dies) = 5(4/13) + 3(9/13) = 47/13 = 3.615
i.e. £36,150

9 (i) The change after a large number of time periods equals the sum of i.i.d.
r.v.s.
The Central Limit theorem leads to an approximate normal distribution.
(ii)
x : +1 0 −1
p : 0.35 0.35 0.30
E(X) = 0.35 − 0.30 = 0.05
E(X2) = 0.35 + 0.30 = 0.65
∴Var(X) = 0.65 − (0.05)2 = 0.6475 ∴s.d.(X) = 0.8047
Let Y = price change after 500 periods
∴Y has mean 500(0.05) = 25 and s.d. 500(0.8047) =17.99
P(Y > 20)
