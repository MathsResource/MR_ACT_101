9 The size of a claim, X, which arises under a certain type of insurance contract, is
to be modelled using a gamma random variable with parameters $\alpha$ and θ
(both > 0) such that the moment generating function of X is given by
M(t) = (1 − θt)−$\alpha$ , t < 1/θ .
By using the cumulant generating function of X, or otherwise, show that the
coefficient of skewness of the distribution of X is given by 2/√$\alpha$. [5]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
10 Let Z be a random variable with mean 0 and variance 1, and let X be a random
variable independent of Z with mean 5 and variance 4. Let Y = X − Z.
Calculate the correlation coefficient between X and Y. [5]

(i) Write down the likelihood function clearly and hence by drawing a rough
sketch of the likelihood function, show that the maximum likelihood
estimator of θ is given by 1 2

(ii) Without calculating ˆ ( ) E θ , explain why ˆθ is a biased estimator of θ.

12 A market research company intends to estimate the proportion of the population,
θ, who support a certain political party. They intend to poll a sample large
enough so that a 95% confidence interval for θ has a width of 0.03 or less. It is
thought that θ is approximately equal to 0.4.
Assuming that everyone questioned will respond to the poll, calculate the
minimum size of sample which the company should take.

Q9 Comment: Many candidates used the MGF directly (and encountered some
algebraic difficulties) rather than using the more convenient cumulant generating
function.

10 Cov(X , Y) = Cov(X , X − Z) = Cov(X , X) − Cov(X , Z) = V(X) − 0 = 4
V(X) = 4, V(Y) = V(X) + V(Z) = 5
so Corr(X , Y) = 4/(4 × 5)1/2 = 0.894
OR:
By independence, it is immediate that Y has mean and variance both equal
to 5.

The independence of X and Z implies that E(XZ) = 0, and as

then max(Xi) < θ always
∴ ˆ ( ) E θ < θ ∴ˆθ is biased
Q11 Comment: Few candidates appreciated the significance of the fact that the range of the
variable included the unknown parameter θ and therefore the likelihood L(θ) has a
discontinuity (above which it is decreasing).
12 Assuming n will be large enough to make a normal approximation to the
binomial acceptable, the confidence interval will be
ˆ(1 ˆ ) ˆ 1.96 ,
n
θ − θ θ ± where ˆθ is the proportion of the sample who support the party.
Although ˆθ is unknown, it can be estimated as 0.4, so the width of the interval
will be approximately

We need to take n = 4,098.
(As n is large, this confirms that we were correct in assuming that a normal
approximation would be appropriate.)
Notes: As this answer is approximate, approximations (such as replacing 1.96
with 2) are acceptable, as is rounding the final answer.
An acceptable alternative would be to estimate ˆθ by 0.415 rather than 0.4; this
is the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval for θ. This leads to a value of
n = 4,145.
