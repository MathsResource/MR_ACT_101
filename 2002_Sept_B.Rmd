which has sample correlation coefficient r. Let the fitted value at xi be denoted yi .
Show that the sample correlation coefficient of the data  yi , yi , i =1, 2,, n, that
is, of the observed and fitted y values, is also equal to r. [3]

6 As part of an investigation an insurance company collected data for the year 2000 on
claims sizes for all claims on a certain type of motor insurance policy. The resulting
data are given below in the form of a grouped frequency distribution.
Claim size (£) Frequency

> 200 and  300 1253

> 400 and  500 558
> 500 1290

(i) Calculate the cumulative frequencies and draw a graph of the claim size
distribution function (i.e. the cumulative frequencies against claim size). [3]
(ii) You have been asked to determine the proportion of claim sizes which are less
than £250. Use linear interpolation to approximate this proportion to two
decimal places. [2]
(iii) Use linear interpolation to approximate (to the nearest £) the value of the
median of the claim size distribution. [2]

7 Suppose that X is a continuous random variable uniformly distributed on (0, 1).
(i) Show that the moment generating function of Y =  log X is
MY(t) = 1/(1  t) for t < 1. [3]
(ii) Hence state the distribution of Y. [1]

8 Assume that, for a group of insurance policies, the number of claims on each policy
can be modelled by a Poisson distribution with the same rate  per year,
independently for each policy. Such a group of 1500 policies gave rise to a total of
183 claims during the last year.
(i) State the value of the maximum likelihood estimate of . [1]
(ii) Hence obtain estimates of the following quantities:
(a) The probability that a subset of 10 of these policies results in no claims
over the next six months.
(b) The probability that a subset of 250 of these policies results in more
than 40 claims over the next year. [4]

The maximum claim size is not given, and candidates were expected to exercise common
sense and judgement. One sensible approach is to leave the x-scale open-ended and indicate
the presence of a horizontal asymptote at cumulative frequency 5637.

(ii) This is the MGF of an exponential distribution with parameter 1, and by
uniqueness for the MGF this then implies that Y has this distribution.

(ii) (a) Number of claims X for 10 policies in six months is Poisson with
parameter 10(0.5)(0.122) = 0.61
P(no claims) = P(X = 0) = exp(	0.61) = 0.543
Alternative:
For a single policy P(no claim) = exp(	0.061) = 0.9408
For 10 policies P(no claims) = (0.9408)10 = 0.543
(b) Number of claims X for 250 policies in one year is Poisson with
parameter 250(0.122) = 30.5
Outwith scope of the Green tables, so we must use a normal
approximation:
X  N(30.5,30.5)
Applying a continuity correction:
( 40) ( 40.5) = ( 40.5 30.5 =1.81) =1 0.96485
