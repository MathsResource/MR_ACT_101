5 Ten independent hypothesis tests are to be conducted, each at the 5% significance
level.
Calculate the probability that at least one of the tests produces a significant result,
assuming that the null hypothesis for each of the 10 tests is true, and comment briefly
on the value. 
6 Show that the slope of the regression line fitted by least squares to the three points
(0,0) , (1,y) , (2,2)
is 1 for all values of y.

7 Claims arise through time on a portfolio of policies one after another, at random, and
at a constant rate per week. Claim sizes are to be modelled as a N(, 2) random
variable, independent of the times of occurrence and the accumulated numbers of
claims.
The moment generating function of S, the total size of all claims which occur in a
period of k weeks (where k is a positive integer), is to be used in a theoretical report
being written by two students.
One student (A) suggests that the moment generating function of S is given by:
  : exp exp 1 2 2 1
S 2 Suggestion A M t k t t
       

    
while the other (B) disagrees and suggests that it is in fact given by:
  2 2 : exp exp 1 1
S 2 Suggestion B M t k t t     

One of the students is correct. Determine which one this is. 
8 A student actuary is about to collect data from a batch of insurance proposal forms. It
is known that on average one in every fifty such forms contains incomplete
information, and the student wants to be 95% sure of having at least 500 forms which
are complete.
Show that he must use a batch of at least 516 forms. (Use a suitable model and
appropriate tables for the distribution of the number of forms containing incomplete
information.) 


5 P(at least one test is significant | each null hypothesis is true)
= 1 âˆ’ P(no test is significant | each null hypothesis is true)
= 1 âˆ’ (1 âˆ’ 0.05)10 as the 10 tests are independent
= 0.4
Comment: a false-positive is very likely with the 10 multiple tests.

6 Sxx = 5 â€“ 32/3 = 2 , Sxy = y + 4 â€“ 3(y+2)/3 = 2
So fitted slope = 2/2 = 1
7 N is Poisson(kÎ») with MN(t) = exp[kÎ»{exp(t) â€“ 1}].
S has a compound distribution with mgf MS(t) = MN{logMX(t)}
and MX(t) = exp(Î¼t + Ïƒ2t2/2).
So mgf of S is MN(Î¼t + Ïƒ2t2/2) and correct suggestion is A.
OR: by using the result quoted in the Formulae and Tables book
OR: we must have MS(0) = 1, so B is wrong.

8 Let X be the number of forms with incomplete information in a batch of n forms.
Then X ~ Poisson(0.02n) approximately
With n = 516, X ~ P(10.32) and P(X â‰¤ 16) = 0.965 approx, by linear interpolation
With n = 515, X ~ P(10.3) and P(X â‰¤ 15) = 0.940 approx, by linear interpolation
So he requires 516 forms

OR: the distribution of X can be modelled approximately using a normal distribution
with mean 0.02n and variance 0.0196n; we require P(X â‰¤ n âˆ’ 500) to be at least 0.95;
the analysis is more awkward, but solving a quadratic in n gives n â‰¥ 515
