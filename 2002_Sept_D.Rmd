12 A psychologist conducted an investigation into the effect of alcohol on reaction times
using 10 male and 10 female subjects. Each subject was given two tests on different
days, during which his/her reaction times were recorded.
Before each of the tests, the subject drank a glass of liquid. Some glasses contained a
fixed quantity of alcohol and others contained a liquid which had a similar colour and
taste but no alcohol. Each subject drank one glass of each type. The order of
presentation was randomized, independently for each subject.
The data below give the reaction times, in units of 0.01 seconds. Also given is the
difference between the reaction time with alcohol and the reaction time without
alcohol for each subject (reaction time with alcohol minus reaction time without).

(i) (a) Construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference between
the reaction times with and without alcohol for the males, using the 10
difference values.
(b) Construct a similar 95% confidence interval based on the female
difference values.
(c) Comment briefly on the two confidence intervals. [8]
(ii) (a) Perform a two-sample t-test to investigate whether the alcohol effect
differs between males and females.
(b) Show that the variances in the male and female samples are not
significantly different at the 5% level, and comment briefly with
reference to the test conducted in (ii)(a). [8]

EXAMINERS REPORT
Introduction
The attached subject report has been written by the Principal Examiner with the aim of
helping candidates.  The questions and comments are based around Core Reading as the
interpretation of the syllabus to which the examiners are working.  They have however
given credit for any alternative approach or interpretation which they consider to be
reasonable.

that the alcohol has an effect on reaction times, i.e. it increases the
reaction time.

The F9,9 distribution has upper 5\% critical point at 3.179. Our
observed value (1.626) is well within the main body of the distribution
and is not significant at the 10\% level of testing (and therefore not at
the 5\% level). There is no evidence to suggest that the variances
differ. The assumption of common variance was made when
conducting the test in (ii)(a).

Strongly reject null hypothesis of constant probability over the

safeguard against very low expected frequencies, one should combine
adjacent cells.]

not as good as 32.557.5 age range.

(d) In (i)(b), the probability of having coronary heart disease was found to vary with age. The 99\% confidence interval for the slope parameter in the regression obtained in (ii)(c) also shows that the probability of having coronary heart disease depends (linearly) on age as zero is not within the interval.
