\item 9 Let X and Y be independent random variables. Let V and W be the random variables
defined by
V = max {X, Y}, W = min {X, Y}
i.e. V is the larger, and W is the smaller, of the observations of X and Y.
Let FX , FY , FV , FW denote the distribution functions of X, Y, V, W respectively.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that FV(t) = FX(t)FY(t) . 
\item Show that FW(t) = FX(t) + FY(t)  FX(t)FY(t) . [3]
\item The random variable X has an exponential distribution with parameter 4 and,
independently, Y has an exponential distribution with parameter 4. Obtain the
distribution function of the minimum of X and Y and state its mean. [3]
\end{enumerate}

\item 10 A company wants to estimate the percentage of its customers who are willing to shop
on the internet. It decides to do so by calculating a symmetrical 95% two-sided
confidence interval for the unknown percentage.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that, based on a random sample of 200 of the companys customers, the
required confidence interval will have a width which is no greater than 13.9%.
[4]
\item Calculate the sample size required which will ensure that, whatever the true
percentage, the width of the confidence interval will be no greater than 10%.
\end{enumerate}

\item 11 Consider the following model for aggregate claim amounts S:
S = X1 + X2 + + XN
where the Xi are independent, identically distributed random variables representing
individual claim amounts and N is a random variable, independent of the Xi , and
representing the number of claims. Let X have mean X and let N have mean N and
variance 2
N .
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that
E(SN) = X (2N  2N )
by considering expected values conditional on the value of N. [3]
\item Hence derive an expression for the covariance between S and N.

\item
FV(t) = P(V  t) = P(max {X, Y}  t)
= P(X  t and Y  t) = P(X  t) P(Y  t) = FX(t)FY(t) as X and Y are independent
\item
FW(t) = P(W  t) = 1  P(min{X, Y} > t)
= 1  P(X > t and Y > t) = 1  P(X > t) P(Y > t) as X and Y are independent
= 1  [1  P(X  t)] [1  P(Y  t)]
= 1  (1  FX(t)) (1  FY(t))
= FX(t) + FY(t)  FX(t)FY(t) .
\item
FX(t) = FY(t) = 1  e4t , so
FW(t) = 1  e4t + 1  e4t  (1  e4t)2
= 2  2e4t  1  e8t + 2e4t
= 1  e8t
This is the distribution function of an exponential distribution with parameter 8, and
therefore the mean is 1/8.
