\item Sickness and absence records were kept on 30 employees in a company over a 91-day
period. These data are tabulated below:
Number of employees absent 0 1 2 3 4 5
Number of days 44 19 10 8 7 3
Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation of the number of employees absent
per day. [3]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item A set of claim amounts (Â£) is given below:
192 136 253 138 87
112 221 176 336 203
159 55 308 165 254
Present these data graphically using a boxplot. [3]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\item  The probability that a car accident is due to faulty brakes is 0.02, the probability that a
car accident is correctly attributed to faulty brakes is 0.95, and the probability that a
car accident is incorrectly attributed to faulty brakes is 0.01.
Calculate the probability that a car accident which is attributed to faulty brakes was
due to faulty brakes. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 4 The probability that information held on an individual record on a company's
database is incorrect (e.g. information is out-of-date) is 0.13.
Calculate the probability that in a random sample of 200 records at most 20 contain
incorrect information. [3]
